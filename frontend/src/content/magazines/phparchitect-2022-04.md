## Impacting the World Through Tech

###### Eric Van Johnson

 If you listen to my PHPUgly podcast, you might know that we have a policy of not mixing politics with our tech talk. That is a policy we have been breaking more and more often over the past couple of years.


From the previous presidential term and
through the election, a glaring topic that
started to surface more and more was that
our industry and technology were playing
a more significant role in politics, local
and worldwide. For better or worse, it has
become how people get their news, shape
their opinions, and set the stage for how
people are perceived. Speaking about technology and how it plays into events like the
Russian invasion of Ukraine is unavoidable.
Tech companies and services also know
they can no longer avoid how their products
and offerings might be contributing to atrocities that they do not want to be a part of, and
they have begun to take action. In this April
edition of finally{}, Beth Tucker Long shares
her thoughts in Tech is Taking Sides.
We get Part Four of Ken Marks' Raspberry
Pi series, where he discusses web API and
plotting data. This series has been such a
fantastic read. If you haven’t been keeping
up, go back to the beginning of the year and
read the previous three parts. Ken has been
doing a terrific job explaining the journey of
his real-world solution that he created using
a Raspberry Pi and PHP. Also, congratulations to our second winner of the Raspberry
Pi giveaway, Miguel Gallegos.
Florian Engelhardt contributed a column
this month on a topic matter I had been
wanting for a long time called Growing the
_PHP Core One Test at a Time. Florian walks_
you through the PHP core codebase and
how the tests work. I couldn’t wait to step
through this article. He steps you through
cloning the PHP codebase and through the
testing workflow.
This month, we introduce a new column
called Drupal Dab, contributed by Nicola
Pignatelli. Drupal 9 Introduction and Instal_lation—thetitleprettymuchcoversthetopic._


He walks us through how to install Drupal
and some of the first things to do after you
install it. In this month’s Education Station,
Chris Tankersley takes us down the path of
licenses with some thoughts on choosing one
for our project in his article Which License to
_Choose? He discusses the pros and cons of_
several open-source licenses and explains
the benefits and drawbacks. In Security
Corner, Eric Mann discusses _Operational_
_Security. He touches on what happens when_
disaster strikes, learning from mistakes, best
practices, and the ongoing quest for security.
Next to time, one of the more frustrating
areas to code is money, and in this month’s
PHP Puzzles _Making Some Change, Oscar_
Merida goes over the challenge of making
change. He also shows some solutions to last
month’s challenge on the best ways to make
change.
We’ve all heard the excuses for not having
tests, tests are “confusing”, “difficult”, “takes
too long to write”, or are just “complicated.”
There’s also a saying, “any tests are better than
no test.” In this month, The Workshop, Joe
Ferguson goes over one of the easiest ways
to get some basic tests in your project with
his article Accept Testing with Codeception. I
have personally been a huge fan of Edward
Barnard’s new DDD Alley column. This
month he continues the series with _When_
_the New Requirements Arrive, where he talks_
about what you do when new requirements
for a codebase are introduced and how
to handle them. He touches on the solid
principle, bloated classes, test boundaries,
and more. Frank Wallen continues his new
column, PSR Pickup, where he moves on
to _PSR 12 Extended Coding Style Standard_
and discusses what this PSR is and why you
might want to use it in your projects.

### Growing the PHP Core - One Test at a Time

###### Florian Engelhardt

 In September 2000, I started my vocational training at an internet agency with two teams: one doing JavaServer Pages and one doing PHP. I was assigned to the PHP team, and when presented with the language, I immediately knew that no one would ever use it. I was wrong. Today, my entire career is built on PHP. It’s time to give back to the community by writing tests for the PHP core itself!


###### Prepare Your Machine!

Before you start writing tests for PHP, let’s start with
running the tests that already exist. Fetch the PHP source
from GitHub and compile it to do so.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:php/php-src.git
$ cd php-src
$ ./buildconf
$ ./configure --with-zlib
$ make -j `nproc`

```
I recommend creating a fork upfront because it’s easier to
create a pull request when you finish your test.
If you do not have a compiler and build tools
already installed on your Linux computer, install the
```
development-tools group on Fedora or the build-essential

```
on Debian Linux. The ./configure command may exit with
an error condition; this usually occurs when build requirements are not met, so install whatever ./configure is missing
and rerun that step. Keep in mind that you need to install
the development packages — in my case, the configure script
stated it was missing `libxml, which was, in fact, installed.`
It was really missing the header files in the development
package (usually named with a dev or devel suffix). Note that
the --with-zlib argument to ./configure is mandatory only in
this case, as you will need the zlib extension (which is not
built by default) for the following examples.
After your build is complete, you can find the PHP binary
in ./sapi/cli/php. Go ahead and check what you just created:
```
$ ./sapi/cli/php –v
PHP 8.2.0-dev (cli) (built: Dec 28 2021 19:43:57) (NTS)
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v4.2.0-dev, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies

```
Now that you have a freshly built and running PHP binary,
you can finally run the tests included within the GitHub
repository. Since PHP 7.4 tests may run in parallel, you can
give the number of parallel jobs with the -j argument.
```
$ make TEST_PHP_ARGS=-j`nproc` test

```
```
============================================
TEST RESULT SUMMARY
-------------------------------------------Exts skipped  :  46
Exts tested   :  26
-------------------------------------------Number of tests : 17124       11774
Tests skipped  : 5350 ( 31.2%) -------Tests warned  :  1 ( 0.0%) ( 0.0%)
Tests failed  :  2 ( 0.0%) ( 0.0%)
Expected fail  :  28 ( 0.2%) ( 0.2%)
Tests passed  : 11743 ( 68.6%) ( 99.7%)
-------------------------------------------Time taken   :  40 seconds
============================================

```
This output looks good, and it only took 40 seconds to run
11774 tests — quite fast. Only one warning and two failures,
hooray! You can also see that 5350 tests have been skipped,
and 28 have been expected to fail. You will learn about why
this is in the next part.

###### What Do Tests Look Like?

Now that we know how to execute the tests, let’s look at a
test case. PHP test files have the file ending .phpt and consist
of several sections, three of which are mandatory: the `TEST,`
the FILE, and the EXPECT or EXPECTF section.
```
--TEST-strlen() function
--FILE-<?php
var_dump(strlen('Hello World!'));
?>
--EXPECT-int(12)

###### The TEST Section

```
This section is a short description of what you are testing
in a single line. It must be as short as possible, as the section
is printed when running the tests. You can put additional
details in the DESCRIPTION section.


-----

###### The DESCRIPTION Section

If your test requires more than a single line to describe it
adequately, you can use this section for further explanation.
This section is completely ignored by the test binary.

###### The FILE Section

This section is the actual test case, PHP code enclosed by
PHP tags. It is where you do whatever you want to test. As
you have to create output to match against your expectation,
you usually find var_dump all over the place.

###### The EXPECT Section Figure 1.

This section must exactly match the
output from the executed code in the
```
FILE section to pass.

###### The EXPECTF Section
 EXPECTF can be used as an alterna
```
tive to the `EXPECT section and allows`
the usage of substitution tags you may
know from the printf functions family:
```
--EXPECTF-int(%d)

###### The EXTENSIONS Section

```
You should list all the PHP extensions that your test case
depends on in this optional section. The PHP test runner will
try to load those extensions, and if they are not available, skip
the test. If you depend on multiple extensions, the list must be
separated by a newline character.
In our case, we will list the zlib extension.

###### The SKIPIF Section

This section is optional and is parsed and executed by the
PHP test runner. The test case is skipped if the resulting
output starts with the word skip. If it starts with xfail the test
case is run, but it is expected to fail.

###### The XFAIL Section
```
 XFAIL is another optional section. If present, the test case is

```
expected to fail; you don’t need to echo out xfail in the SKIPIF
section at all if you have this. It contains a description of why
this test case is expected to fail. This feature is mainly used
when the test is already finished, but the implementation isn’t
yet, or for upstream bugs. It usually contains a link to where a
discussion about this topic can be found.

###### The CLEAN Section

This section exists so you can clean up after yourself. An
example might be the temporary files you created during
the test. Keep in mind this section’s code is executed independently from the `FILES section, so you have no access to`
variables declared over there. Also, this section is run regardless of the outcome of the test.


You may find more in-depth details on the file format at the
PHP Quality Assurance Team Web Page[1].

###### What Can You Test?

Now that you know what a PHP test looks like, it is time to
find something to test. Head over to Azure Pipelines[2], click on
the latest scheduled run (look for the calendar icon and the
string “Scheduled for”), and then click “Code Coverage” to
view the code coverage report.

When I started looking for something to test, I found that
the zlib_get_coding_type() function in ext/zlib/zlib.c was
not covered at all (this was back in the PHP 7.1 branch and on
the now-retired gcov.php.net[3] . See Figure 1.
The next step was to check out what this function was
supposed to do in the PHP Documentation[4]. In the documentation and the code itself, I saw that this function returns the
string gzip or deflate or the Boolean value false. The linked
zlib.output_compression directive documentation[5] gave one
additional bit of information: the zlib output compression
feature reacts on the HTTP Accept-Encoding header sent with
the client HTTP request.

###### The Big Picture

In an HTTP request, a client can indicate via the Accept-En```
coding header that it would understand a compressed response

```
using the specified compression algorithms. Additionally, if
the PHP directive `zlib.output_compression is enabled, PHP`
magically compresses the output generated by your script
before sending it to the client, saving bandwidth.

-----

###### Test cases

For the test, this means there are four possible cases to
check for:

 - the absence of the Accept-Encoding header

 - the Accept-Encoding being gzip

 - the Accept-Encoding being deflate

 - the Accept-Encoding being anything else
The last case is treated the same as the first case: The function is expected to return the Boolean value false.

###### Time To Write That Test!

Let’s start with the first test for the case where
there is no `Accept-Encoding header set in the file`
```
test/zlib_get_coding_type.phpt.

```

Listing 1.
```
 1. --TEST- 2. zlib_get_coding_type()
 3. --EXTENSIONS- 4. zlib
 5. --FILE- 6. <?php
 7. ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'Off');
 8. var_dump(zlib_get_coding_type());
 9. ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'On');
10. var_dump(zlib_get_coding_type());
11. ?>
12. --EXPECT-13. bool(false)
14. bool(false)

```

You can run this single test via:
```
$ make test TESTS=test/zlib_get_coding_type.phpt

```
Sadly, this gives you a failed test. You can easily see why
this is the case by checking the test directory contents where
you find your .phpt test file and other files with various file
endings. One that is particularly interesting, in this case, is
the zlib_get_coding_type.log file:
```
---- EXPECTED OUTPUT
bool(false)
bool(false)
---- ACTUAL OUTPUT
bool(false)
Warning: ini_set(): Cannot change zlib.output_compression

```
- headers already sent in test/zlib_get_coding_type.php
on line 4
```
bool(false)
---- FAILED

```
Don’t let these failed tests get you down if this is your
first time learning about PHP internals. These failed tests
are learning opportunities. For example, in this case you
will learn that you cannot change the output compression


setting after your script creates any form of output. For
output compression to work, there is a handler that is called
when we change the zlib.output_compression directive. This
handler checks to see if any output has already been sent,
and if it has, sends a warning.
Let’s dive deeper. Try searching for “zlib.output_compression” in the ext/zlib/zlib.c source code file. You find it in the
call to the STD_PHP_INI_BOOLEAN macro along with the pointer
to the function `OnUpdate_zlib_output_compression in which`
you can spot the warning you received.
Thinking of the big picture of the feature, this totally makes
sense. When the script creates any form of output, PHP
will create and send the HTTP response headers indicating
whether the response will be compressed and, if so, what
algorithm was used We can not toggle this feature anymore
as there is no way of telling the client that part of the response
is compressed and another part is not.
To work around this warning, you can change the `FILE`
section to only create output after the calls to ini_set:
```
<?php
ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'Off');
$off = zlib_get_coding_type();
ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'On');
$on = zlib_get_coding_type();
var_dump($off);
var_dump($on);
?>

```
Rerunning the test case results in your first successful test!
🎉
It’s not time to party yet; there are still other cases to cover.
The next one on the list is the case with the HTTP Accept-En```
coding header set to the string gzip. As a PHP developer,

```
you know you can access and change the HTTP headers via
the super global `$_SERVER. Let’s change the` `FILE and` `EXPECT`
section accordingly as shown in Listing 2.

Listing 2.
```
 1. --FILE- 2. <?php
 3. ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'Off');
 4. $off = zlib_get_coding_type();
 5. ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'On');
 6. $on = zlib_get_coding_type();
 7. $_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING'] = 'gzip';
 8. $gzip = zlib_get_coding_type();
 9. var_dump($off);
10. var_dump($on);
11. var_dump($gzip);
12. ?>
13. --EXPECT-14. bool(false)
15. bool(false)
16. string(4) "gzip"

```

-----

Now run the test via:
```
$ make test TESTS=test/zlib_get_coding_type.phpt

```
The test failed again. Looking into the zlib_get_coding_type.
```
log file, you notice that the third call to the zlib_get_coding_
type() function returned false, not the expected string gzip.

```
It seems like PHP is not reacting to the HTTP header that
you clearly set just one line before. Did we spot a bug in PHP?
The source code tells you: Open the ext/zlib/zlib.c source
code file and search for the variable `compression_coding as`
this is the variable being evaluated in the function you are
testing. You should find some matches, but there is one at
the beginning of the file in the C function php_zlib_output_
```
encoding, which looks like the only place where something is

```
assigned to the variable in question.
Analyzing the source code, not understanding exactly what
is going on, and finally asking for help on the PHP Community
Chat[6] reveals the following: All of your userspace variables
and PHP user-accessible autoglobals ($_GET, `$_SERVER, …)`
are copy-on-write. Altering those from your script creates a
copy for you to work on in userspace, effectively making the
**HTTP request headers immutable to the userspace. The**
PHP core continues to use the original, unaltered version.
Now that you know you can not alter or set the HTTP
header from within your script to influence PHP’s behavior,
this might look like a sad end for your tests code coverage.
Wait, there is more! I did not tell you about another
section in the PHPT file format that might come in handy
now: The `ENV section. This section is used to give environ-`
ment variables to your script that are passed to the PHP
process that runs your test code—meaning you can continue
writing tests and that you have to create a test file per test
case. Let’s create a new test file for the gzip case and name it
```
zlib_get_coding_type_gzip.phpt.

```

Listing 4.
```
 1. --TEST- 2. zlib_get_coding_type() is gzip
 3. --EXTENSIONS- 4. zlib
 5. --ENV- 6. HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING=gzip
 7. --FILE- 8. <?php
 9. ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'Off');
10. $off = zlib_get_coding_type();
11. ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'On');
12. $gzip = zlib_get_coding_type();
13. ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'Off');
14. var_dump($off);
15. var_dump($gzip);
16. ?>
17. --EXPECT-18. bool(false)
19. string(4) "gzip"

```
Run the test and see it fails once more. You might have
expected this by now. 😝
Let’s see what happened by looking into the
```
zlib_get_coding_type_gzip.log file.
---- EXPECTED OUTPUT
bool(false)
string(4) "gzip"
---- ACTUAL OUTPUT

```
�1�0
���B�P�Txꆘ8`5ؑ������s�7a�ze��B+���ϑ�,����^�
```
---- FAILED

```
Wow, this looks like some binary garbage, and yeah, this
does not match the expected output.
Look at your test case. You told PHP that you accept gzip
encoding and you turned on output compression. PHP is
basically just doing what we told it to do. The binary garbage
you see here is gzip encoded data. This means you succeeded
in activating gzip output compression, but forgot to turn it off
before dumping out the two variables. Now, all that’s left is to
add another call to deactivate output compression again so
the final test looks similar to Listing 4.
Rerun this test, and it finally passes! 🎊🥳🎉
Now you’re left writing one test case for the `Accept-En-`
```
coding header being set to deflate and another test case for the
Accept-Encoding header being set to an invalid string (basi
```
cally something that is not gzip or deflate). From this point
on, finishing the test cases is just diligence, and if you like to
cheat, you can find the tests in the ext/zlib/tests/ directory
named:

 - `zlib_get_coding_type_basic.phpt`

 - `zlib_get_coding_type_br.phpt`

 - zlib_get_coding_type_deflate.phpt

 - `zlib_get_coding_type_gzip.phpt`


Listing 3.
```
 1. --TEST- 2. zlib_get_coding_type() is gzip
 3. --EXTENSIONS- 4. zlib
 5. --ENV- 6. HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING=gzip
 7. --FILE- 8. <?php
 9. ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'Off');
10. $off = zlib_get_coding_type();
11. ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'On');
12. $gzip = zlib_get_coding_type();
13. var_dump($on);
14. var_dump($gzip);
15. ?>
16. --EXPECT-17. bool(false)
18. string(4) "gzip"

```

###### Collect Some Evidence!

Now that you have tests for all four cases, you could hope
you covered that function with tests or (a way better option if
you ask me), you could continue and create a code coverage
report! For the report to work, you need to install the `lcov`
tool via your Linux package manager (sudo dnf install lcov
for Fedora or sudo apt-get install lcov for Debian). PHP
was built with `gcov disabled, so we need to run configure`
again, with enabled gcov and recompile.
```
$ make clean
$ CCACHE_DISABLE=1 ./configure --with-zlib --enable-gcov
$ make -j `nproc`

```
This code compiles the PHP binary with enabled code
coverage generation. Lcov will be used to create an HTML
code coverage report afterward. To create your code coverage
report, you need to rerun the tests.
```
$ make test TESTS=test/zlib_get_coding_type.phpt

```
While running the tests, gcov generates coverage files with
a gcda file ending for every source code file. To generate the
HTML code coverage report, run the following:
```
$ make lcov

```
You may find the resulting HTML code coverage report in
```
lcov_html/index.html.

```
It looks like we covered all four cases as shown in Figure 2.

###### What’s in It for You?

PHP becomes more stable and reliable with every test
you write, as functions may not suddenly change behavior
between releases.
Writing tests for PHP gives you a deeper understanding
of how your favorite language works internally. In fact, by
reading up to this point, you may have learned that HTTP
request headers are immutable to userspace, that there is such
a thing as userspace, and that there are handler functions
called to check what you are doing when you want to change
ini settings at runtime.


Also, knowing the PHPT file format
gives you other benefits as well:
PHPUnit[7] not only supports the PHPT
file format and can execute those tests,
part of PHPUnit is tested with PHPT
test cases. This skill led me to become
a PHPUnit contributor: Writing
PHPUnit tests in the PHPT file format.

### How to Hack your Home with a Raspberry Pi - Part 4

###### Ken Marks

 Welcome back to another installment of How to Hack your Home with a Raspberry Pi*. At the end of this article, you will have an accelerometer data plotting application running on your Raspberry Pi. You will need to start from the beginning of the series if you want to build this project yourself.


###### Introduction

Here’s what we’ve covered so far in parts 1 thru 3:

 - Part 1:

   - My motivation for this project

   - Components needed

    - Installing the OS on the Pi

   - Configuring the Pi

 - Part 2:

   - Updating the software packages on your Pi

   - Installing and testing the LAMP Stack

 - Part 3:

   - Connecting the accelerometer

   - Creating the database for storing accelerometer
data

   - Compiling a C/C++ program that reads accelerometer data and logs it to the database

    - Creating a Unix Service to automatically start and
stop logging
In this installment we will:

 - build a web service that uses the logged accelerometer
data

 - and build an application that plots the accelerometer
data

###### Power Up Your Pi and Remotely Log in

Ensuring your accelerometer is properly connected to your
Raspberry Pi (see part 3), connect the power supply to your
Pi and plug it into A/C mains.

###### Ssh Into Your Pi

After a few minutes of letting the Pi power-up, bring up a
terminal window on your computer. Next, SSH into your Pi
with the user pi by typing the following command into the
terminal:

```
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

```
Enter your password. You should now be logged in to your
Raspberry Pi.

_Update the Packages_

I’ll first check to see if any software packages need
upgrading on the Pi using the apt package manager and run
the following two commands in the terminal window:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

###### Building a Web Service

```
We ultimately want to build a web application that plots
the accelerometer data in real time. So first, let’s create a
simple REST service with a single endpoint that provides
the following two mechanisms for reading the accelerometer
data:

 - Getting the newest accelerometer data and its id

 - Getting all the accelerometer data starting with the next
newest row of data after the id sent, all the way up to
the newest data along with the newest accelerometer
data’s id.

💡 What is REST? REST[1] stands for REpresentational
```
 State Transfer. If this acronym isn’t confusing enough,

```
_we have many alternative names for it such as RESTful_
_service, web API, or web service. At the great risk of_
_giving an oversimplified definition, REST is a means of_
_transferring data (typically defined as a noun in the URI)_
_using HTTP verbs representing the intent of what we_
_are doing with the data. Going forward, I will refer to this_
_as a web service. We use web services to expose an API_
_for accessing a CRUD object (another acronym meaning_
_Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which is a code wrap-_
_per for accessing our database tables)._

1 [REST: https://w.wiki/7iv](https://w.wiki/7iv)


-----

Since all we need from our web service is to retrieve data,
we will only use the _HTTP verb_ `GET. When a client makes`
an HTTP GET request to our service, we’ll return a JSON[2]
payload containing the accelerometer data, making it really
flexible for any programming language to interact with this
service. For example, I could create an application entirely in
PHP using Guzzle[3] or in JavaScript using AJAX to interact
with the web service.

###### Accelerometer Data Web Service Api

Table 1.

**HTTP Verb** **CRUD Action**

POST Create record

GET Read record(s)

PUT Update record

DELETE Delete record

We won’t require any authentication to keep it simple,
and we won’t worry about versioning our service either. As
mentioned, there is just one endpoint, and we will create it at
the following location to interact with our web service:
```
http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/

```
The first time we call our service, we want to get the latest
accelerometer data, so we will send an _HTTP GET request_
without any parameters as shown in Table 2 row 1.
We want the _JSON data we get back to contain the latest_
accelerometer reading, its timestamp, and its ID. See Listing 1.
Then we can plot this data point in the plotting application
we will create using the timestamp.
Remember, our accelerometer logging service is saving
data every 100 milliseconds. Therefore, we will use the last```
MeasurementId as an input parameter the next time we request

```

```

data from the web service to get all the data points since the
above request.
For our next call to our service, we will send an _HTTP_
_GET request (Table 2 row 2) with the lastMeasurementId as a_
parameter to get all the data since our last request.
We want the JSON data we get back to contain all the accelerometer data since the last request and the newest reading’s
ID as shown in Listing 2.
If this request is exactly 10 seconds since the last request,
we should have 100 measurements in the JSON payload.

###### Creating the Accelerometer Data Web Service

I have created a PHP web service containing the endpoint
script and a CRUD wrapper class to retrieve the acceleration
data from the database and convert it into a JSON payload to
be sent to the requesting client.

|HTTP Verb|Endpoint|Parameter|
|---|---|---|
|GET|http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/|[none]|
|GET|http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/|lastMeasurementId|

                                          10.

```
Table 2. `11.`
```
                                          12.

```
**HTTP** `13.`
**Verb** **Endpoint** **Parameter** `14.`
```
                                          15.

```
GET http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/ [none] `16.`
```
                                          17.

```
GET http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/ lastMeasurementId
```
                                          18.
                                          19.

```

_Download the Accelerometer Service Scripts_

In the terminal window, within your `Downloads folder,`
download the `accelerometerservice.zip[4] file to your Pi`
using wget:
```
cd ~/Downloads/
wget https://www.phparch.com/downloads/accelerometerservice.zip

```
In the terminal window, unzip the `accelerometerservice.`
```
zip file and move the accelerometerservice folder to the /var/
www/html/ folder:
unzip accelerometerservice.zip
sudo mv accelerometerservice/ /var/www/html/

```
The web service contains the scripts shown in Table 3.
And our web service endpoint is now located at: `http://`
```
raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/

```
_accelerometerdata.php_

First, let’s take a look at AccelerometerData.php in Listing 3.
This class is for fetching data from a database table into
an object. You can see that the properties in this class match
the fields in the accelerometer_data table in the Accelerom**eterData database. Each object of this class will represent a**
row from a query into the table. I’ve added magic getters and
setters and a __toString() method for completeness, but we’ll
just be using the magic getter.

_accelerometerdatamanager.php_

Listing 4 is our CRUD wrapper the `AcelerometerDataMan-`
```
ager class. This class has two public methods:

```

- `readLatest() retrieves the newest accelerometer data,`
including its id


-----

Listing 4.
```
 1. require_once('AccelerometerData.php');
 2.
 3. class AccelerometerDataManager
 4. {
 5. const HOST = "localhost";
 6. const DB = "AccelerometerData";
 7. const USER = "accelerometer";
 8. const PW = "accelerometer";
 9.
10. public function readLatest()
11.   { ... }
12.
13. public function readFromIdToLatest($id)
14.   { ... }
15.
16. private function
17.   getJsonEncodedDataFromAccelDataObjects(
18. $accelDataObjects
19.   )
20.   { ... }
21. }

```


 - `readFromIdToLatest($id) retrieves all the accelerometer`
data since the id (passed in as a parameter) and the
newest id. If the id is not found in the table (due to it
being deleted because it’s older than 60 seconds), return
all 60 rows of the accelerometer data.
The class also has one private utility method:

 - `getJsonEncodedDataFromAccelDataObjects($accelData-`
```
  Objects) that we will use to create a nested associative

```
array from the accelerometer data and convert it into a
_JSON payload._
Let’s take a look at the getJsonEncodedDataFromAccelDataOb```
jects() (Listing 5) method first.

```
The parameter,$accelDataObjects, is an array of one or
more AccelerometerData objects fetched from the accelerom**eter_data table.**
The foreach() loop builds a nested associative array (called
```
$measurements) containing the accelerometer data from the

```
array of AccelerometerData objects.
After processing all of the accelerometer data, we will
continue to build the nested associative array by creating
an array called `$accelerationData with a key of` `accelera-`
```
tionData. The key contains another array with two key/value

```

Listing 5.
```
 1. private function
    getJsonEncodedDataFromAccelDataObjects($accelDataObjects)
 2. {
 3. $measurements = array();
 4.
 5. foreach ($accelDataObjects as $accel)
 6.   {
 7. $measurements[] =
 8. array(
 9. 'axis' =>
10. array(
11. 'X' => $accel->axis_x,
12. 'Y' => $accel->axis_y,
13. 'Z' => $accel->axis_z
14.           ),
15. 'dateTime' => $accel->created
16.       );
17.   }
18.
19. $accelerationData =
20. array(
21. 'accelerationData' =>
22. array(
23. 'accelerationMeasurements' => $measurements,
24. 'lastMeasurementId' => $accel->id
25.         )
26.     );
27.
28. return json_encode($accelerationData, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
29. }

```

pairs: `accelerationMeasurements containing the` `$measure-`
```
ments array as a value, and lastMeasurementId containing the

```
value of the last ID processed from the `AccelerometerData`
object array(which will be the newest reading).
Finally, we call `json_encode() to convert the completed`
associative array `$accelerationData into a pretty printed`
_JSON payload and return it to the calling method._
Let’s take a look at the `readLatest() method in Listing`
6, which will return the newest accelerometer data reading
along with its primary key ID.
Using PDO, we create a connection to the **Accelerome-**
**terData database and we will handle exceptions. Next, we**
will query the newest row of data in the accelerometer_data
table and fetch the results into an array of AccelerometerData
objects — there should only be one object in the array. If


-----

something goes wrong with the query, we will return 0 to the
calling function. We pass this AccelerometerData object array
to the `getJsonEncodedDataFromAccelDataObjects() method`
and return the JSON payload to the calling function.
Finally, let’s look at the readFromIdToLatest($id) method in
Listing 7 which will return all the accelerometer data readings
since the reading specified by the $id parameter.
This method takes an ID corresponding to a row in the
**accelerometer_data table. Using PDO, we create a connec-**
tion to the AccelerometerData database, and we will handle
exceptions. Next, we will query all the newest rows of data
in the accelerometer_data table greater than the $id passed
in and fetch the results into an array of `AccelerometerData`
objects. Notice we are preparing and binding our incoming
```
$id to :id to prevent SQL injection. If something goes wrong

```
with the query, we will call the readLatest() method to return


the newest accelerometer data reading. Finally, we pass this
```
AccelerometerData object array to the getJsonEncodedDataFromAccelDataObjects() method and return the JSON payload to

```
the calling function.

_index.php_
```
 index.php (Listing 8) serves as the entry to our web service

```
endpoint.
First we grab the HTTP REQUEST method from
```
$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']. Next, we instantiate an Acceler
```
`ometerDataManager object. Then we will` _switch on_ `$httpVerb.`
We will only process _HTTP GET requests and throw an_
Unsupported HTTP request exception for anything else.

Listing 7.
```
 1. public function readFromIdToLatest($id)
 2. {
 3. $retVal = NULL;
 4.
 5. $db = new PDO("mysql:host=" . self::HOST . ";dbname="
 6. . self::DB, self::USER, self::PW);
 7. $db->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
 8.
 9. // Get the 'created' date from the given id
10. $sql = "SELECT id, created, axis_x, axis_y, axis_z "
11. . "FROM accelerometer_data WHERE id > :id "
12. . "ORDER BY id";
13.
14. try
15.  {
16. $query = $db->prepare($sql);
17. $query->bindParam(":id", $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);
18. $query->execute();
19.
20. $results = $query->fetchAll(
21. PDO::FETCH_CLASS,
22. "AccelerometerData"
23.    );
24.
25. if (is_array($results) && count($results) >= 1)
26.   {
27. return
28. $this->getJsonEncodedDataFromAccelDataObjects($results);
29.   }
30. else
31.   {
32. // Just get the latest reading
33. $retVal = $this->readLatest();
34.   }
35.  }
36. catch(Exception $ex)
37.  {
38. echo "{$ex->getMessage()}<br/>\n";
39.  }
40.
41. return $retVal;
42. }

```

Listing 6.
```
 1. public function readLatest()
 2. {
 3. $retVal = NULL;
 4.
 5. $db = new PDO("mysql:host=" . self::HOST . ";dbname="
 6. . self::DB, self::USER, self::PW);
 7. $db->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE,
 8. PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
 9.
10. // Get the latest measurement
11. $sql = "SELECT id, created, axis_x, axis_y, axis_z "
12. . "FROM accelerometer_data "
13. . "ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1";
14.
15. try
16.  {
17. $query = $db->prepare($sql);
18. $query->execute();
19.
20. $results = $query->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_CLASS,
21. "AccelerometerData");
22.
23. if (is_array($results) && count($results) == 1)
24.   {
25. return $this->
26.     getJsonEncodedDataFromAccelDataObjects($results);
27.   }
28. else
29.   {
30. $retVal = 0;
31. $retVal = json_encode($retVal, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
32.   }
33.  }
34. catch(Exception $ex)
35.  {
36. echo "{$ex->getMessage()}<br/>\n";
37.  }
38.
39. return $retVal;
40. }

```

Once we’ve determined the request method is an HTTP GET,


-----

we will send an HTTP header
with the content type of
`application/json,` so the
client’s browser knows to
expect a _JSON payload. If_
a query parameter named
```
lastMeasurementId is passed

```
in we will call the readFromId```
ToLatest() method passing

```
in the query parameter
contained in `$_GET['last-`
`MeasurementId'].` Otherwise,
we will call the `readLatest()`
method. Both of these
methods will return a _JSON_
payload which is echoed out
to the client.

###### Testing Our Web Service

We have several ways we
can test our web service to see
if we’re getting the expected
_JSON payload:_


Listing 8.
```
 1. require_once("AccelerometerDataManager.php");
 2.
 3. $httpVerb = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']; // POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, ...
 4.
 5. $accelerometerDataManager = new AccelerometerDataManager();
 6.
 7. switch ($httpVerb)
 8. {
 9. case "GET":
10. // Read
11. header("Content-Type: application/json");
12. if (isset($_GET['lastMeasurementId'])) // Read (by lastMeasurementId)
13.     {
14. echo $accelerometerDataManager->readFromIdToLatest($_GET['lastMeasurementId']);
15.     }
16. else
17.     {
18. echo $accelerometerDataManager->readLatest();
19.     }
20. break;
21.
22. default:
23. throw new Exception("Unsupported HTTP request");
24. break;
25. }

```

Figure 1.


Bring up a browser tab on your local computer and navigate to `http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/.`
You should see a JSON payload that returns the newest accelerometer data and looks something like Figure 1.

Notice the `lastMeasurementId and its value. We will use`
this as a query parameter in our next request to query all the
accelerometer data since this request.


Assuming less than 60 seconds have transpired,
bring up another tab in your browser and navigate to
```
http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/?lastMeasurementId=41820. You should see a JSON payload that returns

```
all the newest accelerometer data since the lastMeasurementId
and looks something like Figures 2 and 3.
Now, I’ll show you how to use curl to test your web service
if you have it installed as a command-line utility. Open up
a terminal window on your local computer and type the
following command:
```
curl --location --request \
GET 'http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice'

```

💡 NOTE: When we request all the data
_since this last request, keep in mind that the_
```
accelerometerdatalogging.service is only storing

```
_60 seconds worth of data. So if you request all the data_
_since the lastMeasurementId and more than 60 seconds_
_have passed, you will retrieve the latest 60 seconds worth_
_of accelerometer measurement data. This web service_


-----

In Figure 4, you should see the JSON payload returned. If
you like, you can repeat this command with the query parameter added onto the end of the URL to get all the newest
measurement data since the lastMeasurementId.

###### Building a Plotting Application

Now that we know our accelerometer data web service is
working, we will build a client-side web application using
JavaScript that makes an AJAX call to the web service to get
the latest accelerometer entries every second. We will use
_Smoothie Charts[5] (a JavaScript charting library) to plot the_
accelerometer data in real time.

_Download the Accelerometer Plotting Application Scripts_

In the terminal window, within your `Downloads folder,`
download the accelerometer.zip[6] file to your Pi using wget:
```
cd ~/Downloads/
wget https://www.phparch.com/downloads/accelerometer.zip

```
In the terminal window, unzip
the accelerometer.zip file and move
the `accelerometer folder to the`
```
           /var/www/html/ folder:
unzip accelerometer.zip
sudo mv accelerometer/ /var/www/html/

```
The plotting application contains the following scripts
shown in Table 4.
Our accelerometer plotting application is now located at:
```
http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometer/.

```
I’m not going to go through the `smoothie.js library, but`
if you want to know more, a ten-minute tutorial[7] shows
you how easy it is to use. And a configuration tool called
_Smoothie Charts Builder[8] allows you to set various options_
and generates the HTML and JavaScript you need for these
options.

However, I want to walk through the rest of the scripts with
you so you understand how our plotting application works
and integrates with our web service.

_NOTE: Smoothie Charts has many options not covered in_
_the Smoothie Charts Builder. You will need to peruse the_
_well-documented smoothie.js library to find them._

_index.html_

I will again use the Bootstrap[9] CSS framework for our
_Accelerometer Data page. See Listing Listing 9._
We’re starting out with a typical boilerplate Bootstrap web
page. The things I want you to note are we need a canvas:
```
<canvas id="acceleration_data_plot_canvas"
style="width:100%; height:100px"></canvas>

```
Our canvas will be a fixed height of 100 pixels and responsive to the width of the canvas.
Next, we need to include JQuery because we will be making
some AJAX calls to use our web service:

```

 integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4="

```
Then we need to include our `smoothie.js library and our`
```
acceleration.js script containing our functions:
<!-- Smoothie Charts and Accelerometer Data Plotting Code -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="smoothie.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="acceleration.js"></script>

```
And lastly we need to call our `plotAccelerometerData()`
function:
```
<script type="text/javascript">
 plotAccelerometerData();
</script>

```
_js_get_server_name.php_

This script will return the name of the server as JSON to an
AJAX call from the acceleration.js script and will be used to
construct the URL to the web service endpoint:

```

property to point to our web service with the endpoint URL:
```
http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometer/.

```
Next, we need to specify the plot lines for each axis of
accelerometer data. Smoothie Charts requires us to create a
```
TimeSeries object for each plotline:
function plotAccelerometerData()
{
    ...
    let x = new TimeSeries();
  let y = new TimeSeries();
  let z = new TimeSeries();
    ...
}

```
Then we will call `setInterval(), which will call the`
`getLatestAccelerometerData()` function every
one second, passing in the time series objects
for each axis. `getLatestAccelerometerData()`
will retrieve one second’s worth of accelerometer data and
append it to the time series objects. See Listing 13.
In Listing 14 we will instantiate our SmoothieCart object.
We will set our chart to be responsive, so when we resize
the width of our canvas, the chart will adjust accordingly.
We also set the `grid parameters and` `labels. You can exper-`
iment with some of these settings using the Smoothie Charts

```
<?php
  header('Content-type: application/json');
  $server_name = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
  print json_encode(array('server_name' => $server_name));

```
_acceleration.js_

This script has functions for getting the latest accelerometer
data from the web service and plotting it to a canvas using
**Smoothie Charts.**
First, we will create a couple of properties. The first property is for holding the URL to our web service endpoint used
in AJAX calls to the service. The second property will hold
the ID of the last read accelerometer data. See Listing 10.
In Listing 11 we will have two functions:
```
getLatestAccelerometerData() and plotAccelerometerData().

```
Let’s look at the `plotAccelerometerData() function first, as`
it will show us how to set up and use the Smoothie Charts
library. `plotAccelerometerData() is the entry point that is`
called from index.html.
First, we need to construct a proper URL of our
web service endpoint (Listing 12), so we will use
```
jQuery.getJSON() to get our JSON encoded server name

```
using an AJAX HTTP GET request and set the `Server.url`


Listing 13.
```
function plotAccelerometerData () {
...
 setInterval(function () {
  getLatestAccelerometerData(x, y, z);
 }, 1000);
...
}

```

Listing 14.
```
 1. function plotAccelerometerData () {
 2. ...
 3.  let smoothie = new SmoothieChart(
 4.   {
 5.    responsive: true,
 6.    grid:
 7.     {
 8.      strokeStyle: 'rgb(125, 0, 0)',
 9.      fillStyle: 'rgb(60, 0, 0)',
10.      lineWidth: 1,
11.      millisPerLine: 250,
12.      verticalSections: 6
13.     },
14.    labels: {fillStyle: 'rgb(255, 255, 0)'}
15.   });
16. ...
17. }

```

-----

_Builder[10] or by looking at the options in the function header_
documentation for the smoothie constructor in smoothie.js.
Then we will add the three `TimeSeries objects to our`
`SmoothieChart object and set the` `strokeStyle,` fillStyle,
and `lineWidth parameters for each axis by calling the`
```
SmoothieChart.addTimeSeries() method:
function plotAccelerometerData()
{
  ...
  smoothie.addTimeSeries(x, { 
    strokeStyle: 'rgb(0, 255, 0)',
    fillStyle: 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)',
    lineWidth: 3 });
  smoothie.addTimeSeries(y, { 
    strokeStyle: 'rgb(255, 0, 255)',
    fillStyle: 'rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)',
    lineWidth: 3 });
  smoothie.addTimeSeries(z, { 
    strokeStyle: 'rgb(0, 0, 255)',
    fillStyle: 'rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)',
    lineWidth: 3 });
    ...
}

```
We’ll set the X-axis green, the Y-axis magenta, and the
Z-axis blue.
Finally, we will call the `SmoothieChart.streamTo() method`
to stream the accelerometer data to the canvas we identified
with the element ID `acceleration_data_plot_canvas with a`
delay of one second to avoid jitter in the display:

10 Smoothie Charts Builder:
[http://smoothiecharts.org/builder/](http://smoothiecharts.org/builder/)

```
function plotAccelerometerData()
{
  ...
  smoothie.streamTo(document.getElementById(
    "acceleration_data_plot_canvas"), 1000);
  ...
}

```
Listing 15 shows the `getLatestAccelerometerData() func-`
tion, which is responsible for getting the accelerometer data
from the web service and adding it to the Smoothie Charts
```
TimeSeries objects.

```
```
 getLatestAccelerometerData will be called once per second.

```
The first time this function is called, we enter the if condition
because we initialized AccelerometerData.lastId to 0. In this
condition, we want to get the newest accelerometer data. All
subsequent calls to this function will enter the else condition
because we will be setting `AccelerometerData.lastId to the`
newest accelerometer data ID.

12.      let dateComps = data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements[0].dateTime.split(/[^0-9]/);
13.      let dateTime = new Date(dateComps[0], dateComps[1] - 1, dateComps[2],

15.
16.      let xValue = data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements[0].axis.X;
17.      let yValue = data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements[0].axis.Y;
18.      let zValue = data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements[0].axis.Z;
19.
20.      axis_x.append(dateTime, xValue);
21.      axis_y.append(dateTime, yValue);
22.      axis_z.append(dateTime, zValue);
23.     }
24.    });
25.  } else // Send GET using last measured Id
26.  { ... }
27. }

```

Let’s look at the if condition logic shown in Listing 16.
First, we request the latest accelerometer data from our
web service endpoint by calling `jQuery.getJSON() to get`
JSON data using an AJAX HTTP GET request. This request
to `http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/ has no`
query parameters. Upon success, the _JSON payload will be_
contained in the data parameter of the anonymous function.
At this point we’ll assign the AccelerometerData.lastId property to the value of the last measure ID:
```
AccelerometerData.lastId =
 data.accelerationData.lastMeasurementId;

```
Since we are only reading one set of measurements all the
data we need is contained in data.accelerationData.acceler```
ationMeasurements[0].

```
The TimeSeries objects passed in require a Date object specifying the datetime of the data we want to append to the series.
The Date object can be instantiated with the datetime string,
however, in order to be compatible with multiple browsers, it
is better to instantiate a Date object with the datetime string
split into individual components as parameters to the `Date`
constructor:


Next we will save the measurement data to local variables:
```
let xValue =
data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements[0].axis.X;
let yValue =
data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements[0].axis.Y;
let zValue =
data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements[0].axis.Z;

```
Finally we will append the `dateTime` `Date object and the`
measurements to each TimeSeries object:
```
axis_x.append(dateTime, xValue);
axis_y.append(dateTime, yValue);
axis_z.append(dateTime, zValue);

```
```
// In order to be compatible with the Safari browser, we cannot just pass in
// the datetime string into the Date() constructor. Instead, we must pass in
// each datetime component as a parameter to the Date() constructor
let dateComps = data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements[0].dateTime.split(/[^0-9]/);
let dateTime = new Date(dateComps[0], dateComps[1] - 1, dateComps[2],
    dateComps[3], dateComps[4], dateComps[5], dateComps[6]).getTime();

```

-----

Listing 17.
```
 1. function getLatestAccelerometerData (axis_x, axis_y, axis_z) {
 2.  if (AccelerometerData.lastId === 0)
 3.  { ... }
 4.  else // Send GET using last measured Id
 5.  {
 6.   $.getJSON(Server.url,
 7.    {lastMeasurementId: AccelerometerData.lastId},
 8.    function (data, status) {
 9.     if (status === 'success') {
10.      AccelerometerData.lastId = data.accelerationData.lastMeasurementId;
11.
12.      data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements.forEach(function (accelerationMeasurement) {
13.       // In order to be compatible with the Safari browser, we cannot just pass in
14.       // the datetime string into the Date() constructor. Instead, we much pass in
15.       // each datetime component as a parameter to the Date() constructor
16.       let dateComps = accelerationMeasurement.dateTime.split(/[^0-9]/);
17.       let dateTime = new Date(dateComps[0], dateComps[1] - 1, dateComps[2],
18.        dateComps[3], dateComps[4], dateComps[5], dateComps[6]).getTime();
19.
20.       let xValue = accelerationMeasurement.axis.X;
21.       let yValue = accelerationMeasurement.axis.Y;
22.       let zValue = accelerationMeasurement.axis.Z;
23.
24.       axis_x.append(dateTime, xValue);
25.       axis_y.append(dateTime, yValue);
26.       axis_z.append(dateTime, zValue);
27.      });
28.     }
29.    });
30.  }
31. }

```

Now in Listing 17 we will look at the else condition logic.
First, we request all the newest accelerometer data since the last measurement’s ID from our web service endpoint by calling
```
jQuery.getJSON() to get JSON data using an AJAX HTTP GET request and including the AccelerometerData.lastId property

```
set as the query parameter lastMeasurementId:
```
http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometerservice/?lastMeasurementId=41877

```
Upon success, the JSON payload will be contained in the data parameter of the anonymous function. At this point, we’ll
assign the AccelerometerData.lastId property to the value of thelastMeasurementId:
```
AccelerometerData.lastId = data.accelerationData.lastMeasurementId;

```
This block of code is essentially the same as that contained in the if condition, however we are reading (approximately) 10
measurements instead of just one. So we will iterate over data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements using the forEach()
method:
```
data.accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements.forEach(function(accelerationMeasurement)
{
    ...
});

```

-----

Figure 5. Accelerometer Data Plot


The rest of the code block (Listing 18) is essentially the
same as the `if block, except we are running it for each`
measurement (set as `accelerationMeasurement) in the` `data.`
```
accelerationData.accelerationMeasurements array/

###### Testing Our Plotting Application

```
Bring up a browser tab on your local computer and navigate
to `http://raspberrypi.local/accelerometer/. Gently shake`
your accelerometer sensor and change its orientation—you
should see a real-time plot of all three axes of your accelerometer data displayed on the web page similar to Figure 5.

###### Conclusion

You now have a web application on your Raspberry Pi that
displays a real-time plot of the activity your accelerometer is
reading. If you have a clothes dryer, go ahead and put your Pi
on top of it the next time dry a load of clothes, and take a look
at the activity! See Figure 6.
In the next installment, we will:

 - Install a State Machine that detects when our accelerometer stops shaking that we can use to detect when our
clothes dryer is done

 - and send a text message to ourselves using sendmail
when our drying cycle is complete.

## Which License to Choose?

###### Chris Tankersley

 Licensing for software, whether it is open source or not, is an integral part of releasing software. The commercialization of software has made it necessary for developers to be explicit in how users or other developers consume their software. Unfortunately, the topic of licensing is not as straightforward as many developers would like it to be.


As a quick refresher, licenses are the legal terms that an
end-user must abide by to use the software legally. This
includes installing, using, or integrating the software in
other pieces of software. Common things the license covers
are personal versus commercial use, how and where software may be installed, and whether or not the end-user may
modify the software.
There is much more to licensing than just “is this software
open source or not?” If you are releasing software, you can
choose from hundreds of available licenses. Why are there so
many, and what are the differences between them? What you
choose affects how users can interact with your software.
As developers, we need to be keenly aware of the licenses
that we use in our own software. Licenses differ in the liberties granted to a developer. And different licenses can have
very serious legal repercussions for a company. Have you
ever worked for a company with a strict “No GPL[1] Software”
policy? There is a very real reason for that.
While software can be used anywhere in the world, my experience and view for this article will be United States-focused. I
am not a lawyer. If you are unsure how something may work
in your country, I would consult with a lawyer familiar with
your local copyright laws. Consider the following descriptions a view on the intentions of the various licenses rather
than hard legal advice.

###### No License

Have you ever come across a repository that you would
love to use, but there is no license file? Congratulations, you
have come across a library or project where you legally have
no usage rights. You should avoid this project at all costs.
A core component of any license is the rights and rules
around using a particular piece of software. If there is no
license, the copyright holder holds all the cards. They have
not granted you any usage rights, and they have not granted
you access to the source code, even if you are looking at the
code on GitHub or another service. They may come after you
legally for using their intellectual property without permission.
While I would love to be altruistic about this, this is the
world we live in, thanks to modern copyright laws. No license
means no rights, even basic usage rights. The project is just

_1_ _[GPL: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)_


taking advantage of lax policy policing by code repository
providers.

###### Public Domain

The Public Domain[2] is not so much a license in-and-of-itself, but rather a declaration of the abandonment of copyright
on a work. In the United States, this declaration is known as
“dedicating.” A work dedicated to the Public Domain is usually
identified with some accompanying text of “This work is
dedicated to the public domain.” Once a work is dedicated to
the public domain, the work is no longer owned by any entity
and free for anyone to use.
The Public Domain is incredibly problematic from a legal
standpoint. The first problem is that, like licensing, dedication to the Public Domain must be declared. Many countries,
including the United States, assign copyright automatically to
the author. There is no legal authority one is required to go
through to establish copyright (though there are legal steps
one can do to help protect and declare the copyright).
Nothing is automatically entered into the Public Domain
except under a few conditions. A work enters the Public
Domains by being dedicated by the original author as
mentioned above, or if copyright expires. Copyright can
expire either naturally or if the author does not file for an
extension. Once copyright is removed, a work enters the
Public Domain.
While this sounds straightforward, copyright is a complicated thing. The rules differ for people versus corporate
entities. Copyright is transferrable, and if this is not meticulously documented, copyright ownership can get cloudy.
Authors of works may or may not have done so “for hire”
(how most software is developed). Corporate acquisitions
and breakups can make it hard to know who owns what
copyright. Shifting rules of the length of copyright can make
it hard to know if a work is due to automatically age out to
Public Domain status.
Assuming copyright ownership is actually known, there
is no legal definition of what “Public Domain” is. There are
rules for copyright as part of the Berne Convention of 1988,
but countries can still enact their own rules. For example, The
US does not require dedication for works before 1988 and

_2_ _The Public Domain:_
_[https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome)_


-----

declared anything before 1927 as Public Domain (with exceptions). Copyright is also handled country-by-country so
that a work could be Public Domain in one country but not
another. This presents a second hurdle for anyone wanting to
use Public Domain software.
Even scarier? The copyright holder could potentially
rescind Public Domain status[3] with the way US copyright
works. Now, all of a sudden, a library your company uses is
no longer Public Domain. What do you do? Since there was
no license agreement, it is unknown, both theoretically and
legally, what would happen if such a thing were to occur.
At the end of the day, much like with no license, Public
Domain licensed software is a minefield and should be
avoided.

###### Public Domain-like License

What happens when you want the legal requirements of a
license but the freedom of Public Domain? You get a variety
of Public Domain-like licenses that effectively say, “I do not
care what you do with this software, and I am putting that
in writing as the copyright holder.” There are a handful of
licenses available that fall under this category, but not all of
these licenses are considered “Open Source.”
The Creative Commons is probably the most popular suite
of licenses from this type of software license. The Creative
Commons is designed as a variety of licenses for authors to
use to better control how their works are used. However, it
is not recommended they be used for software[4]. Creative
Commons 0[5] is the closest to a Public Domain declaration
you can get while still providing legal text.
Another popular license is the Unlicense[6], which includes
anti-copyright language to make it more applicable around
the world. It includes an official copyright waiver as well as
a “no warranty” statement, which is an important declaration missing from many of the Public Domain-like licenses.
In fact, the Unlicense is considered open-source compatible,
unlike other licenses in this category.
While there are a handful of Public Domain-like licenses,
many are legally dubious. One of the more famous examples
is the “Don’t be a Dick[7]” license. On the surface, it looks like
something akin to the Unlicense, but the main focus of the
license is you are granted rights if you “aren’t a dick.” Unfortunately, there is no legal definition for what this means, and
the license even mentions that the few examples given are not
exhaustive. At any point, the copyright holder can just decide
a user has broken the license based on whatever behavior the
author deems is “dickish.”

_6_ _[Unlicense: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense)_

_7_ _[Don’t be a Dick: https://dbad-license.org](https://dbad-license.org)_


It is my opinion that short of a Public Domain-like license
approved by the Open Source Initiative, you should avoid
these types of licenses.

###### Proprietary License

A proprietary license is essentially going to be any license
that is unique to an individual piece of software. For example,
when you install a piece of software like Microsoft Office, you
agree to what they call an “End User License Agreement.” This
agreement contains information that you might expect—it
details how you may install the software, how usage is granted,
and all kinds of other legal stuff.
While a company may copy-and-paste much of the text
between their EULAs, each software’s license governs just
that piece of software. The Windows EULA does not cover
Microsoft Office, and the Windows 10 EULA does not cover
Windows 11 or previous versions of the software. The license
is unique to that specific piece of software.

_Are EULAs and Software Licenses different? It depends on_
_who you ask, as they can cover many of the same topics._
_For what topics we are covering, it is pretty safe to equate_
_an End User License Agreement to various other Software_
_Licenses. One main difference is EULAs tend to not differ-_
_entiate between source code and compiled code, where_
_open-source licenses may be explicit on those two topics._

###### Source Sharing

While many proprietary licenses restrict gaining access to
the source code of a particular piece of software, that is not
a defining factor of a proprietary license. Some software may
come with an option called Source Sharing, where a software
provider allows a customer access to the source code.
I have come across this mostly in enterprise software
where the software provider sells software that solves many
common problems for their customers, but customers may
have very unique workflows or requirements. I used to work
in the insurance industry, and all of our back-office software
came with a source-sharing agreement. Each release of the
software included a full copy of the source code we would
patch with our custom changes and compile on our systems.
We would modify the software to work exactly how we
needed it and work with the vendor and other customers
to get our patches merged into the mainline code by the
vendor. Customers were allowed to share their patches with
the system among themselves. It was very much like a limited
open-source ecosystem.
Where source sharing differs from Open Source licensing,
the original vendor still controls the source. While we
were granted access to the software, we could only share it
with other customers. We were still required to pay a hefty
licensing fee to get access to the software. Most damning of
all, we found out after doing a license audit that the changes
we made had an automatic copyright transfer to the vendor.


-----

What that meant was that the original vendor could, at any
time, take our patches and sell them as their own. They could
even take our patches and lock them behind an even more
expensive license. While we had access to the source code,
the proprietary license dictated that we did not own any of
the code, even the code we wrote.

###### Open Source Licensing

Many people do not realize that despite open-source software arguably being the original way software was distributed,
the term “Open Source Software” was not codified until 1998.
This official definition is called “The Open Source Definition[8]”
and was published by the Open Source Initiative as a copy
of the Debian Free Software Guidelines[9]. These rules specify
what makes a piece of software Open Source.
A collective known as the Open Source Initiative[10] is a
group that helps govern and guide open-source software. This
includes maintaining the “Open Source Definition” as well as
providing various resources for open source projects. One of
their most important projects is a list of open-source licenses
that they consider compatible with the idea of Open Source.
For a piece of software to be considered open source, it
must meet the following guidelines[11] from Wikipedia:

1. **Free redistribution: The license shall not restrict**
any party from selling or giving away the software as
a component of an aggregate software distribution
containing programs from several different sources.
The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for
such sale.
2. **Source code: The program must include source code,**
and must allow distribution in source code as well
as compiled form. Where some form of a product
is not distributed with source code, there must be a
well-publicized means of obtaining the source code
for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost
preferably, downloading via the Internet without
charge. The source code must be the preferred form
in which a programmer would modify the program.
Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed.
Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.
3. **Derived works: The license must allow modifica-**
tions and derived works, and must allow them to be
distributed under the same terms as the license of the
original software.
4. **Integrity of the author’s source code: The license**
may restrict source-code from being distributed
in modified form only if the license allows the

_[11 guidelines: https://w.wiki/4z9P](https://w.wiki/4z9P)_


distribution of “patch files” with the source code for
the purpose of modifying the program at build time.
The license must explicitly permit distribution of
software built from modified source code. The license
may require derived works to carry a different name
or version number from the original software.
5. **No discrimination against persons or groups: The**
license must not discriminate against any person or
group of persons.
6. **No discrimination against fields of endeavor: The**
license must not restrict anyone from making use of
the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used
in a business, or from being used for genetic research.
7. **Distribution of license: The rights attached to the**
program must apply to all to whom the program is
redistributed without the need for execution of an
additional license by those parties.
8. **License must not be specific to a product: The**
rights attached to the program must not depend
on the program’s being part of a particular software
distribution. If the program is extracted from that
distribution and used or distributed within the terms
of the program’s license, all parties to whom the
program is redistributed should have the same rights
as those that are granted in conjunction with the
original software distribution.
9. **License must not restrict other software: The license**
must not place restrictions on other software that
is distributed along with the licensed software. For
example, the license must not insist that all other
programs distributed on the same medium must be
open-source software.
10. License must be technology-neutral: No provision
of the license may be predicated on any individual
technology or style of interface.

###### Smelly Open Source

Much like Public Domain-like licensing, many licenses
look like open-source licenses but actually restrict what the
user can do. The JSON License[12] is a perfect example with its
famous line, “The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.”
What is legally Good, and what is legally Evil? Even outside
of the legal definitions, an open-source license should not,
and cannot, restrict the user in such arbitrary ways. A truly
open source software license does not restrict what the user
can do nor force the user to do specific things. Rule #6 of
the Open Source Definition expressly invalidates anything
licensed under licenses like the JSON license.

_[12 The JSON License: https://www.json.org/license.html](https://www.json.org/license.html)_

###### Permissive Licenses

Permissive licenses are licenses that are not copyleft licenses
(more about them in a moment) and allow proprietary derivative works. In many ways, this mirrors how software was
originally handled—a developer puts software out into the
world and allows anyone else to use it, even if that code gets
locked up in proprietary software. The general idea is that the
software being available makes the developer’s life easier.
A few of the most common permissive licenses are the
MIT[13], BSD[14], and Apache 2.0 licenses[15]. The MIT and BSD
licenses closely resemble each other, though there are a
variety of BSD licenses that have come out through the years.
This general format is what has inspired many of the “smelly”
open source licenses and shorter licenses.
You may see the BSD license also called the Original BSD
License, and anywhere from the 0 Clause BSD License to a 4
Clause BSD license. Over the years, various rules surrounding
licensed software have changed. For example, the 2 Clause
BSD license drops a non-endorsement requirement that the
3 Clause BSD license includes. The 3 Clause BSD dropped
an advertising requirement that the 4 Clause BSD license
imposed. These days the 2 or 3 Clause BSD license is typically
used.
Personally, I see permissive licenses working best in library
or component code or places where the code is clearly
intended to be used by other code. For example, I release my
dragonmantank/cron-expression[16] library under the MIT
license because it is meant to be used with someone else’s
code. I am more interested in solving a problem for a developer rather than making sure that the developer releases any
changes back into the wild.
The fact that permissive licenses do allow for proprietary
usage is a major downside to this type of license. One of
the most famous examples of this was that Windows 2000
contained BSD licensed code[17] as part of the networking tools
and stack. People were shocked at this, but Microsoft was well
within their rights to use the code as long as they followed the
license. And they did. If you are OK with allowing your code
to be used this way, permissive licenses are a good selection
for your code.

###### Copyleft Licenses

This brings us to Copyleft licenses. Copyleft licenses differ
from permissive licenses in that they require derivative software to be licensed under the license of the software that was
being integrated. As mentioned above, it is perfectly acceptable for permissive-licensed code to be used in software that
does not share that same license (ala BSD code being used

_[13 MIT: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)_
_[14 BSD: https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)_
_[15 Apache 2.0 licenses: https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)_
_16 dragonmantank/cron-expression:_

_[https://github.com/dragonmantank/cron-expression](https://github.com/dragonmantank/cron-expression)_
_[17 BSD licensed code: https://phpa.me/everything2-bsd-windows](https://phpa.me/everything2-bsd-windows)_


in proprietary code). On the other hand, copyleft software
makes it a requirement that the code stay under the same
license. Copyleft licenses tend to cater toward software
freedom more than developer freedom.
The GPL[18] is usually the go-to example of a copyleft license.
The GPL itself was born out of the frustration that proprietary software was causing to developers and how software
was increasingly stripping developers of the rights they used
to have. As part of this, the requirement that GPL-derived
software must also be GPL licensed was a conscious decision. This decision forced developers that altered the software
to distribute those changes when someone asked. In fact, a
derivative license called the Affero GPL[19] (AGPL) even goes
so far as to say that anyone that simply accesses the code can
ask for the source code changes.
I find that copyleft licenses, especially the GPL itself, work
best for full applications. Since applications tend to solve
much larger problems and generally involve a huge amount of
developer hours, it makes much more sense to keep ill actors
from taking the open-source software and just renaming it
and slapping a proprietary label. Imagine if the Linux kernel
was released under the MIT license. Well, we know what
happens.
Two popular operating systems are based on BSD code:

1. The macOS base operating system called Darwin[20]

2. The Orbis OS[21] that powers the Playstation 4 and
Playstation 5

While Darwin started out very open, Apple increasingly
slowed down upstream patches to the OS. While Apple is very
upfront about its use of BSD software, very few realize that
the Playstation is running a BSD-powered operating system.
Sure, both Sony and Apple are legally following what the BSD
license tells them to, but there is a vast amount of work that
neither company is required to release back to the ecosystem.

###### So What do You do?

When you go to release software, think about your goal
for users. Ask yourself this question, “should the software
be proprietary or open-source?” While I wholeheartedly
support open source and believe it is the way software should
be distributed, I use an iPad and iPhone, and I use Windows
for a lot of video gaming. I do a lot of open source work, but
the vast majority of my life has been spent making proprietary software.
If you release software as open-source, do it the proper way.
Use a license approved by the Open Source Initiative, and
make sure you follow the Open Source Definition for your

_[18 GPL: https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)_

software. It is not much work, and you will find a license that
fits your software’s goals.
If you are just a developer, keep in mind what software
you use and make sure you follow the license. Pay particular
attention to what the dependencies of your dependencies
require. Comcast has a license checker[22] that you can use to
scan your composer.lock file to help suss out this information.
Understand what it means to consume software under the
different licenses.
I hope all this information helps clear up a lot of the
misconceptions and unknown pitfalls of licensing. I would
love to live in a world where we just share code and do not
have to worry about the legalities of software design, but this
is the world we live in. All I can say is help spread open-source
software, and use it responsibly.

## Operational Security

###### Eric Mann

 It is remarkably easy to grow complacent in the digital world, but a lapse in security best practices inevitably leads to a lapse in security itself.


There was a lot of confusion in the early days of the cloud.
Our websites started on either dedicated servers or poorly-compartmentalized shared hosts. Over time, virtual servers
began to take over and better segmented unrelated workloads.
Then tools like Amazon’s AWS introduced the concept of a
“managed cloud” of services that promised to make this kind
of management easier.
For most workloads, it did. For those of us still learning
how the cloud differed from a full server, it just made things
confusing.
My first project was to migrate a particular website and
API from a full server into the cloud. Rather than AWS, we
selected an early version of Microsoft Azure. Doing so
simplified our deployment as we didn’t need to worry about
licensing, .Net versions, or manually updating the GAC[1] to
avail custom libraries to the platform.
This simplicity came at a cost.
Our application stack deployed in moments and was both
highly available and remarkably stable. It was fast, efficient,
and meant an end to 5 am wake-up calls because of literal
fires in the facility hosting our old, physical server. The biggest
downside—no email support.
On a dedicated server, I could trigger outgoing email
messages directly. Early versions of Azure did not support
SMTP directly, nor was managed transactional email a
supported service at the time. My solution: open port 25 on a
server in the rack down the hall and allow our Azure-hosted
web service to relay messages through it.
It worked wonderfully!

###### Disaster strikes

The next morning, all of our support queue metrics were
down. No one was getting messages. Customers were calling
in, irate to have not received invoices, documentation, or even
basic responses to questions. Digging in, I discovered that our
corporate IP address—and thus our entire mail server—had
been globally blacklisted.
I’d opened port 25 not just to Azure but to the entire world,
and that world was gleefully using my open relay to spam the
Internet.
As quickly as I’d opened things earlier, I locked that server
down. Instead of routing messages through a server, I dumped
them all to a file that I could pull manually. Then I spent the

_1_ _[the GAC: https://phpa.me/microsoft-gac](https://phpa.me/microsoft-gac)_


rest of the week pleading with blacklist maintainers to reinstate our IP’s reputation so we could keep working.
In the end, Microsoft did release a managed transactional
mail system, and I was able to fully integrate our application.
This empowered our team to keep working while protecting
us from accidentally exposing our internal mail system to
would-be abusers elsewhere in the world.
I believed I could use our mail server in this way for a few
days while I worked out an alternative solution. This mistaken
belief was my undoing. A later review of system logs showed
the abuse started literally minutes after I’d opened the server
to incoming network connections.
My naive sense of “we’ll be fine for a while” stood no chance
against reality.

###### Learning from mistakes

Making mistakes is natural. It’s how we learn, grow, and
develop both personally and professionally. As disastrous as
my email mistake turned out to be, it was one of the most
formative lessons of my early career. I learned never to take
_any security stance for granted, lest my complacency opens_
the door to attackers.
Since then, I’ve seen countless developers fall prey to the
same kind of naivety.
One developer was having trouble with the internal
network mappings on a server for which they were responsible. Rather than ask for help, thus airing their inability to
solve a problem, they elected to take the nuclear route. They
opened their server to traffic from any IP address in hopes
they could connect via SSH and solve the problem. The
further mistake was opening all ports to all IP addresses.
An angry call from an ISP demanding to know why the
server was participating in a DDoS attack later, and we had
the server again locked down. We conducted a rather embarrassing post-mortem of the incident, and the developer, now
understanding the ramifications of their actions, learned the
lesson and moved on.
Another developer had trouble understanding how his
network kept getting breached. His email gateway, messaging
system, and firewall all showed multiple indications of
compromise, but he couldn’t figure out why. We’d completely
wipe and reprovision systems, only to see alerts of malicious
activity later that day. It wasn’t until we got together on a
screen share that the issue was apparent.
As he logged in, we all saw his password—Passw0rd.


-----

Another engineer pointed out how insecure that password
really was. “But I have lower and upper case and a number.
Wait, I need special characters, don’t I?” He went to change
his password, and sure enough, his current password was
rated as “weak.” He entered Passw0rd! instead and, greeted by
the system’s “strong” rating, assumed everything was golden.
This breach turned out to be a great opportunity to teach
another engineer how to evaluate password strength[2], and he
eventually changed to an _actual strong password. Another_
round of system refreshes, and he hasn’t seen any indication
of compromise in ages.

###### Best practices and the ongoing quest for security

No developer can ever stop learning and say, “I know everything there is to know about software.” Our industry is always
growing, developing, and moving forward. To stop learning is
to let the industry itself pass you by.
To be successful means exercising a practice of continual
learning. You absolutely must learn new technologies, new
languages, new frameworks. You must understand the best
practices in your space today and keep your eyes open to
catch their eventual evolution in the future. Adaptability is
the name of the game and is a hard requirement for ongoing
operations.
At least any operations that have a hope of any modicum
of success.

_2_ _[password strength: https://phpa.me/password-strength](https://phpa.me/password-strength)_


###### Operational Security

Security in tech is no different from any other discipline.
Things deemed secure today might be breached tomorrow as
the industry learns, evolves, and adapts. There is never a state
of “done” when it comes to security, so don’t fool yourself into
thinking security can be ignored. The tech world moves fast—
you need to move faster to stay ahead.
Learn what it means to secure your network:

 - Implement a strong firewall and don’t open unnecessary
ports to the world

 - Focus on refreshing your understanding of entropy and
password strength

 - Use a password manager to eliminate human memory
as the weak chain in your authentication scheme

 - Implement multi-factor authentication[3].
Security is the responsibility of everyone involved in
operations. As best practices continue to shift us towards a
world where every developer is involved in operations, we’re
moving quickly into a space where we’re _all responsible for_
operational security as well.

## Accept Testing with Codeception

###### Joe Ferguson

 Acceptance testing is my favorite tool to reach for when working with legacy applications that may have low test quality or no tests at all. Because acceptance testing approaches the application from outside of the source code, we’re able to greatly increase test coverage without having to touch the application’s code itself. Larger teams can use acceptance tests to prove new features behave as expected. For the single developer that knows they should be writing tests but still doesn’t for whatever reason: acceptance testing can help them jump-start their application’s test suite.


###### WHAT IS ACCEPTANCE TESTING

One of the most common test scenarios might be, “Can a
user log in to our application and land on a specific URL we
expect?” This scenario covers _many methods in our appli-_
cation, giving us more test coverage at the expense of our
test failures being more difficult to debug because so many
methods are involved. If we find ourselves building a new
feature, we can leverage acceptance testing to prove our
feature works as expected, and we can also test our failure
scenarios to prove our validation logic and form processing
are what we expect.
Acceptance testing is a method of verifying our application behaves exactly as expected, often utilizing a web
browser. We will write test scenarios that will be acted out
by a user interacting with our application, such as logging
in or performing a specific task. Acceptance tests are slower
than unit tests because they rely on a web browser. What we
lose in the speed of running acceptance tests we gain the
confidence that our application works as designed with a
real web browser. For small teams, acceptance testing can be
your first step into a formal quality assurance (QA) process.
Whereas unit tests focus on testing isolated methods
and feature tests focus on testing specific methods working
together, acceptance testing exercises our application just as
real users would by clicking on links, filling out forms, and
processing data. We can create users easily, set permissions,
and then verify those permissions are enforced. This level of
detailed step-by-step testing provides incredible confidence
the application behaves as expected. Acceptance testing is
not a replacement for unit tests. Even in situations of legacy
applications where acceptance tests are the only tests, we
still write unit tests for new functionality.
How much of our tests should be unit or acceptance? Do
we need 100% coverage? It depends. Test coverage is about
confidence in your code. Does 100% unit test coverage give
you confidence? What gives me confidence is knowing my
applications behave as I expect them to. Acceptance testing
also allows me to turn user stories into test scenarios and
easily translate business requirements into acceptance tests.


When our tests exercise the application in the exact same
way real users will, the result is confidence in our test suite.
Acceptance testing isn’t the solution for fast test feedback
and should not replace unit tests. Acceptance tests should
augment your existing test suites and add a layer of confidence that your users can interact with your application
exactly as you’ve designed and tested.
Why Codeception[1] and not something like Behat[2] or
Kahlan[3] Behat and other Behavior Driven Development
(BDD) style testing frameworks are designed to test the
application’s behaviors. Read about Kahlan in the September
2018[4] issue. With Codeception’s acceptance test suite, we can
run scenarios with real users in real browsers. Codeception
has been around the PHP ecosystem for 10 years or more,
and the project has matured into a robust solution for fullstack testing. Codeception supports functional, unit, and
API test suites out of the box, making it a perfect choice for
new applications and legacy applications that may not have
a test suite at all.

###### Getting Real

How we wire up this real web browser with Codeception
is via Selenium[5]. Selenium is a suite of tools for automating
web browsers, a very wide and open-ended topic. We will
skip most of the configuration and complexity that often
comes with Selenium by utilizing selenium-standalone[6]
from NPM.

There are multiple ways you can install selenium-standalone:

1. as a global NPM package—npm install seleni```
   um-standalone -g

```
2. save the package to your project—npm install sele```
   nium-standalone --save-dev

```
3. run via docker—docker run -it -p 4444:4444
```
   webdriverio/selenium-standalone

```
If you have installed the NPM package the next step is
to run `sudo selenium-standalone install to download the`
Chromedriver and Selenium packages. By default, we’ll
get the Selenium, Chrome, Firefox, and Chromiumedge
drivers installed for us to use. To start the service, we’ll use
```
selenium-standalone start, which will listen on port 4444 by

Since we’re using real browsers to test our application, I felt
it was fitting to pull a _real PHP project: Snipe-IT. Snipe-IT_

help manage all of that headache. The project was so successful
snipeyhead[7] founded a company[8] to provide a hosted version

to contribute to the project, and it’s an incredible example of
a modern Laravel based application. I’m currently using PHP
8.0 and working off the develop branch due to a new major
version release (6.0!) coming in the near future. My development environment is Ubuntu 20.04 LTS; however, these

I have my Snipe-IT running at http://snipe-it.test[9], and
once upon a time, the project featured Codeception. But if
you’re just getting started with Codeception, you can use

composer require "codeception/codeception" --dev to install

###### ccept est g t Codecept o

Because Codeception has previously been used, we’ll
review the configuration from the root of the project and
verify we’re ready to run the Acceptance test suite found in
the tests/Acceptance folder of the project. The root configuration defines where the Codeception test suites will be located
along with support and data directories, and the extension configuration can be leveraged to run only failed tests.
Listing 1 shows these configurations, which can be found in
```
codeception.yml.

```

Our acceptance test suite has its own configuration file to
specify how this suite should operate. Most importantly, we
configure the WebDriver module to use the URL for our local
development environment and specify the `chrome browser.`
We’re also going to configure the Laravel module[11] to utilize
the ORM, so we have access to Eloquent in order to perform
any setup or teardown actions we may need for specific
scenarios.
The configuration file containing Listing 2 is located at
```
tests/acceptance.suite.yml. Codeception uses these Yaml

configuration files to create generated code helpers for your
test suite. When you make a change to a configuration file,
you need to run php vendor/bin/codecept build (Figure 3) to
build the support classes Codeception needs.


an existing tests/acceptance/LoginCest.php test scenario we
can start with, shown in Listing 3.

15.     $I->seeElement('input[type=text]');
16.     $I->seeElement('input[type=password]');
17.   }
18. }

```

The _before method can be used to do any setup required
before we start executing our test cases. In our LoginCest, we
open the login page, expect to see some text and then see
form elements for password and text fields. We can give
this test a run by itself via `php vendor/bin/codecept run`

Listing 4.
Running our tests confirms our user can log in as shown
in Figure 6.
What if we changed our username from snipe to joe? Let’s
run our tests again and see an example (Figure 7) of a test
failure.
We can see from the output that our username or password is incorrect, as we expected. The added bonus that
Codeception brings is that we have the HTML output
from our application AND a screenshot of when our test
failed. We can inspect the contents of tests/_output and see
```
LoginCest.tryToLogin.fail.html and as shown in Figure 8
LoginCest.tryToLogin.fail.png.

```
```

###### ccept est g t Codecept o

Armed with the full HTML output from our application
and a screenshot of what the browser saw, we can debug what
potentially went wrong. In our example test case, we can
verify the user is experiencing the “username or password is
incorrect” error.
You might notice a lot of output happening in the window
where you ran `selenium-standalone start. This window is`
the back end of Selenium running our headless browser to
execute our tests. If you run into a test failure that doesn’t
make sense, we can review these logs to see if something in
Selenium was breaking. In most cases, you should be able to
safely ignore this output.
It’s important to understand what we’re testing. With our
acceptance test LoginCest.php, we are testing a lot of different
parts of the application as well as UI elements, log-in form
validation, database access, and generally, everything
required to allow a user to log in to our application is fully
functional. This test is how we can gain large amounts of test
coverage of our codebase at a tradeoff of the test failures being
more obscure and possibly more difficult to debug because
so many methods are involved. This type of test is how we
can validate all of our authentications, and login-related unit
tests work when we put them all together and authenticate
and redirect a user. If you’re building these tests in a legacy
application that does not have an existing test suite, you gain
confidence in your refactoring work by writing tests to validate the system is working in its current state. You hope the
current state is working, but it may not always be; the known
state is more important here.
Codeception also supports using helper methods such as
logging in a user to make this code easily reusable. We can
add helper methods to `tests/_support/AcceptanceTester.`
```
php, and we see there is an existing test_login() method

```
that attempts to login our `snipe user. Our static` `test_login`
method contains:
```
public static function test_login($I)
{
  $I->amOnPage('/login');
  $I->fillField('username', 'snipe');
  $I->fillField('password', 'password');
  $I->click('Login');
}

```
With this helper method, we could refactor our tryToLogin()
test to contain our helper method. We could also add our
expanded test to the helper, so we know we’re validating the
login actually works for our test user.
```
public function tryToLogin(AcceptanceTester $I)
{
  $I->test_login($I);
}

```

Running our test again (Figure 9) validates our LoginCept.
```
php test functions as expected.

```
Figure 9.

We can utilize these helper methods to log in administrators as well as less privileged users to verify our permissions
are being enforced without having to copy and paste the same
few lines of code in each of our test cases.
Everyone tests their application. Some of us automate it.
You test your application when you deploy it and then click
around production to “make sure nothing obvious is broken.”
What if we could know there’s a problem _before we deploy_
our code? Codeception gives you the ability to open your
application in your browser of choice and click around and
use the system exactly as your real-world users would. With
selenium-standalone, you can skip most of the complexity
typically involved in Selenium. If you don’t already have a
quality assurance team, acceptance tests can be your start.
If you’re already working with a QA team, Codeception is a
fantastic way to expand your test coverage directly from the
people already testing your application manually. If you’re not
testing your application in an automated way, start today with
Codeception and start small. Test coverage doesn’t happen
instantly but you will gain confidence as your test suite
expands to cover more of your application.

not war.

## When the New Requirement Arrives

###### Edward Barnard

 When the new requirement arrives, does this mean we cram it in the best place, making our software more difficult to work with, or might we have ways to make the result cleaner than before we started? We’ll take advantage of Martin Fowler’s concept of Preparatory Refactoring.


This article will be short and to the
point—because we planned it that
way—without knowing what the new
requirement might be.

_“I love it when a plan comes_
_together.” George Peppard as_
_Colonel Hannibal Smith leading the_
_A-Team (1983)_

Over the past three “DDD Alley”
articles, we have been developing
production code and tests for the
athlete Season Registration workflow.
The new requirement, which I’m about
to describe, is perfectly reasonable and,
in fact, we perhaps should have seen it
coming.

###### New Requirement

Once an athlete completes registration, we send an email confirmation.
That’s perfectly normal and expected
behavior for a website, right? What’s
more difficult here is determining who
needs to receive that email. The athlete
registration might or might not require
the athlete’s email address based on age
and other considerations (under age 13,
under age 18, etc.). That athlete might
or might not have guardian information. This requirement, again, is based
on athlete age and other considerations.
Therefore, one part of the “send email
confirmation” requirement is determining recipients based on business
rules. Those are the same business rules
we discussed previously (“Turning to
Domain-Driven Design” in January
2022 php[architect]), so we won’t repeat
the discussion here.
The other part of our new requirement is to retrieve the relevant email
addresses from our database. This


retrieval, at first glance, is easy. Why?
Because those email addresses are in
the same tables already being accessed
via our “role-based lookups” class.

###### Solid Principles

Not so fast! We have, to this point,
been structuring our architecture
around the SOLID[1] principles of
object-oriented programming. The “O,”
the Open-closed principle[2], explains
that software should be open to extension but closed to modification. What
does that mean to us here?
The Open-Closed Principle means
that when we receive a new use case, we
should aim to implement that new use
case without touching any existing software. We should (in theory) be adding
files without modifying existing files.
Our first instinct was to extend (i.e.,
edit) the role-based lookups class. Sure,
it gets bigger and more bloated, but that
gets our new feature out the door as
quickly as possible. Can we do better?
Yes, we can!

###### Bloated Class

We walked through a long discussion of this very possibility last month
(“Better Late Than Never” in March
2022 php[architect]). We noted Martin
Fowler’s advice for our situation (Refac_toring: Improving the Design of Existing_
_Code, 2nd edition, p. 82):_

_The clients of such a class are often_
_the best clue for splitting up the_
_class. Look at whether clients use_
_a subset of the features of the class._

_1_ _[SOLID: https://en.wiki/wiki/SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)_

_2_ _Open-closed principle:_
_[https://w.wiki/3AG4](https://w.wiki/3AG4)_


As Beck warns, our change may be
difficult. Why is this? Because we have
full unit test coverage. Our unit tests are
in lockstep with our production code.
Our first task, then, is to create a proper
test boundary.

_3_ _explains:_
_[https://phpa.me/twitter-kent-beck-change](https://phpa.me/twitter-kent-beck-change)_

_4_ _preparatory refactoring:_
_[https://phpa.me/martinfowler-refactoring-ex](https://phpa.me/martinfowler-refactoring-ex)_


_Each subset is a possible separate_
_class. Once you’ve identified a_
_useful subset, use “Extract Class”,_
_“Extract Superclass”, or “Replace_
_Type Code with Subclasses” to_
_break it out._


Our new requirement (which is to
lookup email addresses) uses a subset
of the features of the existing class.
The fact, that we’re using a subset of
the features of the existing class, is our
signal to consider some sort of refactoring.
Kent Beck explains[3] the approach
we’ll take:


_For each desired change, make the_
_change easy (warning: this may be_
_hard), then make the easy change._


Martin Fowler calls Beck’s advice
preparatory refactoring[4]:


_This is where I’m adding a new_
_feature, and I see that the existing_
_code is not structured in such a way_
_that makes adding the feature easy._
_So first I refactor the code into the_
_structure that makes it easy to add_
_the feature._


-----

###### When the New Requirement Arrives

 Test Boundary

Robert C. Martin explains in Clean Architecture: A Crafts_man’s Guide to Software Structure and Design, pp. 251 and 252:_

_The issue, of course, is coupling. Tests that are strongly_
_coupled to the system must change along with the system._
_Even the most trivial change to a system component can_
_cause many coupled tests to break or require changes…_

_The way to accomplish this goal is to create a specific API_
_that the tests can use to verify all the business rules… The_
_purpose of the testing API is to decouple the tests from the_
_application… The goal is to decouple the structure of the_
_tests from the structure of the application. [Emphasis in_
_the original.]_

It’s time to extract an interface.
But first, let’s note the terminology I’m about to use here.
We have a possibility of confusion by calling this refactoring
“Extract Interface.”

  - Fowler’s Refactoring, second edition, explains “Extract
Class” and mentions adjusting interfaces (p. 183) as part
of the “Extract Class” refactoring.

  - However, Fowler’s Refactoring, first edition, includes the
“Extract Interface” refactoring (p. 341). That is not what
we’re doing here.

  - PhpStorm, on its “Refactor” menu, includes “Extract/
Introduce > Interface…”. This PhpStorm operation is
what we’re doing here.


Why are we extracting an interface? The unit tests, and only
the unit tests, will use the interface. Does it make sense to
create a production interface that is only being used by the
automated tests? Absolutely! Yes!
More importantly, extracting that interface allows the tests
to evolve in one direction while the production code possibly
evolves in a different direction. The interfaces describe the
needs of the individual clients of our “role-based lookups”
class. We are fulfilling the “I” in “SOLID,” which is the interface segregation principle[5]:

_No code should be forced to depend on methods that it_
_does not use._

###### Preparatory Refactoring

Here are the steps of our preparatory refactoring:

 - Run all the unit tests. They should all be passing before
we begin to refactor.

 - Create an interface based on the role-based lookup
class’s public methods. I used PhpStorm’s built-in
“Refactor > Extract/Introduce > Interface” tool to do so.

 - Change the role-based lookup class to implement the
interface.

 - Run the unit tests. They should all pass as-is.

 - Change the unit tests to reference the interface.

 - All tests should still pass.

###### When the New Requirement Arrives


###### Implement Feature

Now we can easily support our new
feature. Note that the following steps
do not change existing code. Also,
note that the above steps (the preparatory refactoring) did not change any
existing functionality.

 - Define the public methods we
need for the new feature, i.e.,
the methods extracting email
addresses from the database.

 - Create an interface describing
those methods.

 - Create an empty class implementing that interface and
extending the original rolebased lookups class.

 - All current tests should still pass.

 - Develop tests and production
code implementing that new
feature.
Listing 1 shows the new interface.
The beginning of the implementation looks like Listing 2.

###### Extract Superclass

                     31. public function userIsUnder18(): bool;

```
With all unit tests in place and `32. }`

one more step to make the code easier
to understand and follow. I moved the _Refactoring, 2nd edition page 376, lists the steps to take for_

Note that we created the new feature first. Only after the After creating that superclass, the main role-based lookups

we move the “memoize” support to a parent class.

10. $this->loadAlternateGuardianEmailAddress();
11. if (null === $this->alternateGuardianEmailAddress) {
12. return '';
13.     }
14. return $this->alternateGuardianEmailAddress->email;
15.   }
16. }

```

## Drupal 9 - Introduction and Installation

###### Nicola Pignatelli

 Hello everyone. Welcome to the first of a series of articles that will take you into the world of Drupal, one of the most popular Open Source CMS used for various installations types, from the personal blog to the corporate site up to ad hoc software to solve specific requests. Versions currently installed on the web are 7, 8, and 9.


From the list below, you can see the EOL of any version. It
must be remembered that version 7 was supposed to reach
the EOL in November 2021. But due to COVID-19, it was
extended to November 2023 to accommodate the companies
and associations that use it and could not afford the update
with a monetary invention.

**Version** **End of Life**

7.0 November 2023

8.0.0, 8.1.0, 8.2.0, 8.3.0 November 2021

9.0 EOL not defined

10.0 not defined

###### Difference Between Drupal Versions

Drupal 8 introduced the Symfony framework within the
core, the Twig framework for frontend templating, page
loading speed is improved thanks to entity caching, and
javascript is now loaded only when necessary.
Drupal[1] 9 is built on top of version 8, allowing for an easier
upgrade.
Drupal 10, expected to be available in June 2022, has two
key improvements. The use of Symfony 5 or 6 replacing
version 4, and the mandatory use of PHP 8 to keep the system
secure.


###### Requirements for Drupal 9

 - PHP 7.3+. PHP[3] 8 is supported from Drupal 9.1.0

 - Web Server

    - Apache[4] 2.4.7+

    - Nginx[5] 0.7.x+

 - Database Server

   - MySQL[6] or Percona 5.7.8+

   - MariaDB[7] 10.3.7+

   - SQLite 3.26+ is required

   - PostgreSQL 10+ with the pg_trgm extension

 - Drush[8]

   - version 10+ requires PHP 7.1+

   - version 11+ requires PHP 7.4+

###### Other Software

 - Composer[9]

###### Download Drupal 9 Via Composer

Composer is a tool to install/manage the libraries on which
your project depends. Remember that installing Drupal 8.0
or later with tarball is not a problem because starting with
Drupal 8.0, Composer was pre-installed. Run the commands
in Listing 1 to download and install Composer. Listing 1

|Version|End of Life|
|---|---|
|7.0|November 2023|
|8.0.0, 8.1.0, 8.2.0, 8.3.0|November 2021|
|9.0|EOL not defined|
|10.0|not defined|

The last line will generate the composer-phar file. This file is
the Composer binary. It is a PHAR (PHP archive), an archive
format for PHP that can be run on the command line. If you
want to install the composer-phar file in a particular directory, launch the setup with the following command:
```
php composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin \
--filename=composer

```
Otherwise let’s copy it manually:
```
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

```
To clear the installation:
```
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

```
To Install Drupal, launch the following command:
```
composer create-project \
drupal/recommended-project site.dev

```
The previous command will download the current official
release of Drupal. If you want a different version, add the
version number to the command after a colon. For example,
to download version 9.3.6:
```
composer create-project \
drupal/recommended-project:9.3.6 site.dev

```
A list of all releases is available from Drupal. For the latest
9.3 version, use drupal/recommended-project:^9.3 in the
above command, or drupal/recommended-project:^9 for the
latest Drupal 9 version.

###### Install Drupal Using the Standard Web Interface

After Composer finishes downloading the packages, you
can navigate your browser to your site’s URL and start the
setup. It’ll ask for the database credentials, a name for the
admin user, and some basic information.

###### Configure Apache

Install Apache using the following command.

```
sudo apt install apache2

```
Write into file /etc/hosts this line:
```
127.0.0.1 site.dev

```
You can configure Apache to use a virtual
host. In Listing 2, I show a directive to use in file
```
/etc/apache2/sites-available/site.dev.conf.

```
Use the following code to create a symbolic link to this file
and reload apache configuration:
```
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/site.dev.conf \
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/site.dev.conf
sudo service apache2 reload

###### Configure Mariadb

```
The following commands install a database.
```
sudo apt install mariadb-server
sudo apt install mariadb

```
To secure MariaDB, run the following command:
```
sudo mysql_secure_installation

```
Login to MariaDB:
```
sudo mysql -uroot -p

```
Execute the following commands to create a database and
grant privileges.
```
CREATE DATABASE db_test;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db_test.*
  TO 'test'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED BY 'test1234';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

composer require drush/drush

```
Use `drush site:install to run the command line set-up`
wizard. It’ll install the standard profile without any arguments
and ask only for database credentials.
```
drush site:install

```
To personalize the installation, use the following command
to re-install using the expert install profile and set the default
language to Italian.
```
drush site:install expert --locale=it

```
Install using the specified DB params:
```
drush site:install \
--db-url=mysql://test:test1234@localhost:3306/db_test

```

```
drush site:install --account-pass=mom

```
Installation based on the yml files stored in the config
export/import directory:
```
drush site:install --existing-config

```
Disable email notification during install and later:
```
drush site:install standard \
install_configure_form.enable_update_status_emails=NULL

```

###### Download Drupal 9 Modules/themes Via Composer

Drupal contributed modules have dependencies on thirdparty libraries. If you install these modules/themes using
Composer, it will download all the dependencies for you.
To download Drupal contributed modules or themes with
Composer:
```
composer require drupal/<modulename>
composer require drupal/<themename>

```
For example, if you want to download the smtp module:
```
composer require drupal/smtp

```
The above command will be executed over the web directory, in our example /var/www/html/site.dev. Composer will
automatically update your `composer.json file, adding the`
module to all the other requirements in the list, like this:
```
{
 "require": {

```
"drupal/smtp": "^1.5"
```
 }
}

```
You can enable the Drupal module in two ways. Using the
standard Drupal web-browser interface or using a commandline tool like Drush:
```
drush en smtp

```
To download drush, run the following command:
```
composer require drush/drush

```
In all cases, Drupal also enables module dependencies.

###### Specifying a Version

You can specify the version of the module or theme that
you want to download:
```
composer require 'drupal/<modulename>:<version>'

```
Cases are as follows:

 - composer require 'drupal/token:^1.5' maps to the latest
stable release [number drupal version].x-1.x release of the
module:

 - composer require 'drupal/simple_fb_connect:~3.0' maps
to the latest stable release [number drupal version].x-3.x of
the module.

 - composer require 'drupal/ctools:3.0.0-alpha26' maps to
version [number drupal version].x-3.0-alpha26.

 - composer require 'drupal/token:1.x-dev' maps to [number
drupal version].x-1.x-dev.
Composer will download the latest stable version if you
don’t specify the module or theme version.


Figure 6.


-----

You can download the dev version, but it is not recommended.

###### Search and Browser Module/theme

You can search for Drupal or non-Drupal projects from the
command line using `composer search views, which lists all`
projects that contain relations with views.
You can get info about the module/theme from the
command line. The command, composer search drupal/views,
opens a git page about the project into the browser.

###### Change the Default Installation Path

To change the locations where packages are installed,
update the “installer-paths” section of the composer.json file.
This approach uses the composer/installers package and uses
a configuration such as shown in Listing 3.
In addition to the package type-based installation locations,
you can use vendor-specific ones, like this:
```
"extra": {
  "installer-paths": {
    "web/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/{$name}": \
      ["vendor:ckeditor-plugin"]
  }
}

```
Or package-specific ones, like this:
```
"extra": {
  "installer-paths": {
    "web/libraries/{$name}": [ "enyo/dropzone" ]
  }
}

```
If a particular package matches multiple installer-path
entries, the first one that matches will be used.

###### Updating Drupal 9 with Composer

To update the Drupal site using Composer you must first
run `composer outdated "drupal/*", which lists available`
Drupal updates. If there is a line starting with drupal/core,
continue with the commands below:
```
composer show drupal/core-recommended

```
This command verifies if the project uses drupal/core-recommended or drupal/core. If drupal/core-recommended is
installed, it returns information about the package.
If drupal/core-recommended is not installed, it returns
“Package drupal/core-recommended not found.”
Core-recommended is tested and maintains all core dependencies at a fixed version for maximum stability. Drupal/core
is useful when you want to use the latest dependencies and
test that they work well.
If you are using drupal/core-recommended use the
following command:
```
composer update drupal/core "drupal/core-*" \
 --with-all-dependencies

```

###### Drupal 9 Introduction and Installation

Listing 3.
```
 1. "extra": {
 2.   "installer-paths": {
 3.     "core": ["type:drupal-core"],
 4.     "libraries/{$name}": ["type:drupal-library"],
 5.     "modules/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-module"],
 6.     "profiles/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-profile"],
 7.     "themes/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-theme"],
 8.     "drush/{$name}": ["type:drupal-drush"],
 9.     "modules/custom/{$name}": ["type:drupal-custom-module"],
10.     "themes/custom/{$name}": ["type:drupal-custom-theme"]
11.   }
12. }

```

If you are not using drupal/core-recommended, but only
drupal/core, use the following command:
```
composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies

```
To simulate the update without changing anything, use the
following command.
```
composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies --dry-run

```
If there are updates, you can update using the web interface
by visiting `http://site.dev/update.php in your browser or`
with the command line using the following commands:
```
drush updatedb
drush cache:rebuild

```
You can’t use Composer to see security updates; you must
use drush.
```
drush pm:security

###### Updating Drupal 9 Into Production

```
If the above steps were performed on a dev/staging environment, to update an online production environment, copy
composer.json and composer.lock files to production. Then
run the following commands:
```
composer install --no-dev on production
drush updatedb

###### Notes About Drupal 9 Update

```
Before updating the site, make a backup of your files and
database.
Always read the core release notes. Some contributed
modules or themes may need updating to work with a new
minor version of Drupal core. Patch releases shouldn’t
require this. To detect the needed module or theme updates,
you need to read the project page or release notes.


-----

###### upa 9 t oduct o a d sta at o

 Backup Database

To activate maintenance mode, use the following
commands:
```
drush state:set system.maintenance_mode 1
drush cache:rebuild.

```
To dump the database, use the following command:
```
drush sql:dump

```
When finished, enable the site again with the following
command:
```
drush state:set system.maintenance_mode 0

###### Backup File System

```
Traditional backup of file system is executed by tar or zip
software.
```
tar cvfz backup.tgz \
 --exclude="/var/www/html/site.dev/vendor/" \
 /var/www/html/site.dev

```
You can use the “Backup & Migrate” module for alternative
backup.
```
composer require drupal/backup_migrate
drush en backup_migrate

###### Update Drupal 9 Modules/themes with Composer

```
Commands for modules and themes are similar to Drupal
core. The following command list available updates:
```
composer outdated "drupal/*" -->

```
This one lists available security updates:
```
drush pm:security --> List security updates

```
Use the following command for a minor-version update to
a given Drupal module/project:
```
composer update drupal/modulename --with-dependencies

```
To preview the update without changing anything, add
```
--dry-run.
composer update drupal/modulename --with-dependencies \
--dry-run

```
For a major version upgrade (such as 1.x to 2.x), execute
the following steps:

  - Require the new major version explicitly.
```
composer require drupal/modulename:^2.0

```
  - Update module and dependencies:

```
composer update drupal/modulename --with-dependencies

```
Finally, execute the following commands.
```
drush updatedb
drush cache:rebuild

###### Conclusion

```
In this article, we talked about installing Drupal 9 through
Composer, also mentioning the installation via a web interface. Since Drupal 8, Composer has become essential for the
core installation and contributed modules/themes because it
allows you to delegate the management of all dependencies
of various modules. Imagine downloading and installing a
module by hand, but after going to the modules page, you see
that you need to download three other mandatory modules.
Then after downloading them, you notice that they have
additional dependencies. An endless nightmare! But by using
Composer all this no longer matters. Composer will take
care of downloading everything you need starting from the
request of the first module. In addition to Drupal modules/
themes, Composer will also download and configure thirdparty libraries.
Composer has many options, which you can see with the
following command:
```
composer --help

```
If you want to see options about a command you must
execute the following:
```
composer --help list

```

## Making Some Change

###### Oscar Merida

 This article looks at a practical math problem most developers are likely to run into at some point. We’re given some amount of money and asked to figure out how to distribute it. Did you remember that computers are not very good at floating-point math?


###### The Naive Way

Your first attempt at a solution likely
uses floats directly, as in Listing 1. The
approach is logically correct. If we want
to know how many $20 bills are in an
amount, we divide amount by $20.00 and
use floor()[1] to get rid of any decimal
remainders. We then reduce `amount by`
```
20.00 times the number of bills we need.

```

###### Recap

You’re given a non-zero amount of
dollars. Write a script that outputs the
coins and dollar bill denominations
that total the amount. The program
must minimize the number of bills and
coins used. For this exercise, assume
you can use $100, $50, $20, $10, $5,
and $1 dollar bills and quarters, nickels,
dimes, and pennies.


For example, if the amount is $267.51,
your script should output:
```
2 $100 bills
1 $50 bill
1 $10 bill
1 $5 bill
2 $1 bill
2 quarters
1 penny

```

Listing 1.
```
 1. $amount = 267.51;
 2.
 3. echo "Starting amount: {$amount}" . PHP_EOL;
 4. if ($amount >= 100.00) {
 5. $hundreds = $amount / 100.00;
 6. echo floor($hundreds) . " $100 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
 7. $amount = $amount - (floor($hundreds) * 100.00);
 8. }
 9.
10. if ($amount >= 50.00) {
11. $fifties = $amount / 50.00;
12. echo floor($fifties) . " $50 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
13. $amount = $amount - (floor($fifties) * 50.00);
14. }
15.
16. if ($amount >= 20.00) {
17. $twenties = $amount / 20.00;
18. echo floor($twenties) . " $20 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
19. $amount = $amount - (floor($twenties) * 20.00);
20. }
21.
22. if ($amount >= 10.00) {
23. $tens = $amount / 10.00;
24. echo floor($tens) . " $10 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
25. $amount = $amount - (floor($tens) * 10.00);
26. }
27.
28. if ($amount >= 5.00) {
29. $fives = $amount / 5.0;
30. echo floor($fives) . " $5 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
31. $amount = $amount - (floor($fives) * 5.00);
32. }
33.

```

Listing 1 continued.
```
34. if ($amount >= 1.0) {
35. $ones = $amount / 1.0;
36. echo floor($ones) . " $1 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
37. $amount = $amount - (floor($ones) * 1.00);
38. }
39.
40. if ($amount >= 0.25) {
41. $quarters = $amount / 0.25;
42. echo floor($quarters) . " quarter(s)" . PHP_EOL;
43. $amount = $amount - (floor($quarters) * 0.25);
44. }
45.
46. if ($amount >= 0.10) {
47. $nickels = $amount / 0.10;
48. echo floor($nickels) . " nickels(s)" . PHP_EOL;
49. $amount = $amount - (floor($nickels) * 0.10);
50. }
51.
52. if ($amount >= 0.05) {
53. $dimes = $amount / 0.05;
54. echo floor($dimes) . " dimes(s)" . PHP_EOL;
55. $amount = $amount - (floor($dimes) * 0.05);
56. }
57.
58. if ($amount >= 0.01) {
59. $pennies = $amount / 0.01;
60. echo floor($pennies) . " pennies(s)" . PHP_EOL;
61. $amount = $amount - (floor($pennies) * 0.01);
62. }
63.
64. echo "Remaining amount: " . $amount;

```

Finally, we move on to the next smallest bill or coin that we
have.
For many starting amounts, the code does output the
correct breakdown of denominations and coins. But it does
not work for all amounts, including the one given in our
puzzle.
Looking at the output of our program—I have it echoing
the starting and remaining amounts. When it reaches the
code to calculate the number of pennies required, the value
of our remaining amount value has somehow drifted to less
than one cent. However, the drift is enough that it does not
divide by 0.01. Our solution is wrong.
```
Starting amount: 267.51 
2 $100 bill(s)
1 $50 bill(s)
1 $10 bill(s)
1 $5 bill(s)
2 $1 bill
2 quarter(s)
Remaining amount: 0.0099999999999909

###### Converting to Integers

```
For consistency across input amounts, we must avoid
using floating-point values. For any currency, we work with
the smallest, indivisible unit of coinage that can be traded.
In many cases, we can convert a two decimal number into
an integer representing the number of hundredth units we
have. For American dollars ($USD), we convert our starting
number to an equivalent number of pennies. To do so, we
multiply our starting amount (a float value) by 100 and cast
it to an int.
```
$amount = (int) ($amount * 100);

```
The rest of the code (see Listing 2) requires a couple of
changes:

 - All the values for a denomination or coin are multiplied
by 100 to express them as an equivalent number of
pennies.

 - We can use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder. We use this remainder to check against the next
smaller denomination we have.

 - The pennies case collapses since any amount we
have remaining when we get to that step can only be
expressed as some number of pennies between 1 and 4.

###### Removing Repetitive Code

Our preceding solution is technically correct, but I see
some repetitive code that I’d like to reduce. Moving chunks of
similar code into reusable, abstract functions always pays off.
Not only is the resulting code easier to read, but maintaining

```
 1. $amount = 267.51;
 2. // convert to integer number of pennies
 3. $amount = (int) floor($amount * 100);
 4. // denominations
 5. echo "Starting amount: {$amount}" . PHP_EOL;
 6. if ($amount >= 10000) {
 7. $hundreds = (int) ($amount / 10000);
 8. echo (int) $hundreds . " $100 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
 9. $amount = $amount % 1000;
10. }
11.
12. if ($amount >= 5000) {
13. $fifties = (int) ($amount / 5000);
14. echo (int) $fifties . " $50 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
15. $amount = $amount % 5000;
16. }
17.
18. if ($amount >= 2000) {
19. $twenties = (int) $amount / 2000;
20. echo floor($twenties) . " $20 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
21. $amount = $amount % 2000;
22. }
23.
24. if ($amount >= 1000) {
25. $tens = (int) ($amount / 1000);
26. echo (int) $tens . " $10 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
27. $amount = $amount % 1000;
28. }
29.
30. if ($amount >= 500) {
31. $fives = (int) ($amount / 500);
32. echo $fives . " $5 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
33. $amount = $amount % 500;
34. }
35.
36. if ($amount >= 100) {
37. $ones = (int) ($amount / 100);
38. echo $ones . " $1 bill(s)" . PHP_EOL;
39. $amount = $amount % 100;
40. }
41.
42. if ($amount >= 25) {
43. $quarters = (int) ($amount / 25);
44. echo $quarters . " quarter(s)" . PHP_EOL;
45. $amount = $amount % 25;
46. }
47.
48. if ($amount >= 10) {
49. $nickels = (int) ($amount / 10);
50. echo $nickels . " nickels(s)" . PHP_EOL;
51. $amount = $amount % 10;
52. }
53.
54. if ($amount >= 5) {
55. $dimes = (int) ($amount / 5);
56. echo $dimes . " dimes(s)" . PHP_EOL;
57. $amount = $amount % $dimes;
58. }
59.
60. if ($amount >= 1) {
61. echo $amount . " pennies(s)" . PHP_EOL;
62. $amount = $amount - $amount; // 0
63 }

```

Listing 2.


-----

it is simpler because any changes you need to make for a fix
are in one place.
In Listing 3, I’ve added a function to perform our division
and return both the quotient—the number of bills or coins—
and the remaining amount to breakdown. To loop through
the calculations, I define an array of the bills and coins in
our cash registers. An immediate benefit of doing so is that
we could, in the future, use this array to represent the state
of a cash register and the actual bills and coins available for
making change.
While lines-of-code is not a great measure of productivity
or quality, this solution is 26 lines shorter than the previous
one—about 2/3 as long. Removing the repeated code
improves maintainability. If we have to make a change to it,
we need to make the change in one place. If we had to make


###### g g

the same change on multiple lines of the code, we risk a typo
or accidentally skipping one of the spots. Most of our time is
spent reading and maintaining code, not writing new code.
Crafting your code with an eye towards maintainability pays
off in the long run.

###### Floating-Point Values

Working with floating-point values, also referred to as
doubles or floats, are challenging for all computers and
programming languages. It’s not limited to PHP but a result
of trying to represent base-10, fractional numbers in silicon
registers built for binary operations. If you perform sensitive
calculations with floats, consider using the functions from
the bc_math[2] library that comes with PHP.

###### Working With Currency

If you take anything from this month’s solution, remember
that working with money is tricky. In this case, we’re only
working with one currency. Think about what might go wrong
when you’re converting between dollars and pounds, yen, or
euros. How would you write code that has to handle transactions in multiple currencies without sacrificing accuracy? You
would not want to rely on memory to convert floating-point
values to integers throughout your code. Instead, use a Value
Object to represent currency amounts for performing calculations. MoneyPHP[3] is a robust library from X that you can
use in any PHP application. Read “Bug-free Money Handling
with MoneyPHP”[4] to learn more about it.

###### Controlled Randomness

For next month, let’s try to harness randomness such that
we can guarantee that a given input will produce the same
random sequence.

_Given a positive integer, produce a sequence of six colors._
_The colors can be red, green, blue, yellow, purple, or black._
_The same integer input must always produce the same_
_sequence of colors in the same order. Varying the input_
_integer by one digit must produce a new sequence that_
_is entirely different such that you can predict how the_
_sequence changes when the integer input changes._

Given `672985, your code should consistently produce the`
same sequence. green-purple-black-purple-black-purple.

## PSR 12 Extended Coding Style Standard

###### Frank Wallen

 In last month’s column of PSR Pickup, I talked about PSR-4:Autoloader (PSR-0 was the first Autoloader PSR) and PSR-1:Basic Coding Standard. In this month’s column, I’ll be talking about PSR-12:Extended Coding Style Standard. PSR-12 builds on PSR-1 and is significant in the number of rules it defines, most of which are formatting styles well-supported by modern IDEs.


Modern IDEs have alleviated most of the styling expected
from the programmer, cleaning up with a simple keystroke
or mouse-click. For that reason, I will focus more on the
rules that, in my opinion, have more “real world” implications. What I mean by that are those particular rules similar
to PSR-1’s rule about Byte Order Marking (BOM) in a file
that can produce real-world bugs. Whereas whether we use
```
StudlyCaps or snake_case for class names has much more to

```
do with style and communication between developers (not
that communication is not important, of course) than the
functionality of our scripts. However, it’s also important to
follow the standards defined and expected in one’s team. Not
everyone follows all PSR rules exactly. The needs of technology,
architecture, legacy, etc., and the team preferences must be
considered. In my experience, teams working in legacy applications opt to follow the original style more closely, placement
of braces, variable name casing (i.e., snake_case vs. camelCase)
in the scripts where changes are made (corrections or new
code). Often, the expectation is not to make a commit to the
repo strictly for style changes; many teams feel it is not a good
use of time for the developer and PR reviewers.
This PSR supports and expands on PSR-1. An excellent
example of the evolving nature of PSRs is PSR-12 which
replaced and deprecated PSR-2:Coding Style Guide. PSR-2
was accepted in 2012, but there have been numerous changes
to the PHP language since then, and adopting it could result
in a large amount of work. From the meta-document for
PSR-12:


###### All PHP files MUST use the Unix LF (linefeed) line ending only.

 All PHP files MUST end with a non-blank line, terminated with a single LF.

These two rules seem almost inconsequential, don’t they?
In terms of being compiled for execution, they are inconsequential—no impact on the execution of your code. However,
what can be impacted are the tools used in your development
or deployment pipelines. Some tools only recognize a line
that ends in a LF, so they actually might ignore your last line
of code or have trouble diffing it. If there’s no LF on the last
line and another developer must add lines after that, they
must add a LF before their own lines, meaning that now a diff
tool might think that developer wrote the previous line, the
one that originally didn’t end in a LF. In Figure 1, we can see
that we do not have a LF at the end of line 4:
Now imagine a second developer is adding some code
following line 4. The developer would need to add a LF to
line 4, then add their line on 5. One can clearly see that line 4
was ‘replaced’ and line 5 added, but that really isn’t the case;
only the LF was added to the end of line 4.


Figure 2.


-----

Granted, this isn’t terrible, and luckily most IDEs will automatically add the LF for you.

###### The closing ?> tag MUST be omitted from files containing only PHP.

One reason for this is similar to the BOM in a file. When a
script is imported using require or include and there happens
to be a space after ?>, it could trigger output in the including
file before it has properly emitted its headers, resulting in
the dreaded `Headers already sent error. It might also add`
unwanted whitespace during output. In the browser, that is
less likely to create a problem as the space is invisible and
doesn’t impact the index like a non-breaking space ( ). But if
a download file is generated (like a TAB file), then that could
easily introduce unexpected behavior in the consumer of that
file.

###### Code MUST use an indent of 4 spaces for each indent level, and MUST NOT use tabs for indenting.

This rule is a classic long-running debate among developers. Luckily, an IDE will usually allow you to set the
number of spaces representing a tab, so you can just strike
the TAB key easily, and the IDE inserts spaces. Mixing spaces
with tabs can be handled elegantly by an IDE, leaving the user
unaffected as the code looks properly formatted. But version
control software, like Git, handles whitespace differently. A
```
space followed by a TAB in an IDE appears as if it were only a

```
single TAB, but version control would see the difference and
consider it a change. While not impacting the functionality
of the code, it can present as cognitive friction when another
developer is reviewing the code.
Figure 3 shows TAB characters used instead of spaces and
a space added before the TAB. There is no visual difference in
the IDE and no real issue.

Figure 3.

The screenshot in Figure 4 is taken from a diff on Github.
Note Line 10 now shows a space added before the tab and the
line is considered changed.


###### PSR 12 Extended Coding Style Standard

Figure 4.

Again, this isn’t terrible either, but it highlights the potential
confusion of mixing spaces and tabs. While you may not see
it in the IDE, the diff tool noticed.

###### Conclusion

I have only highlighted the rules from PSR-12 that I
believe can impact the developer’s experience when it comes
to tooling and collaboration. There are many more rules in
PSR-12[1] that I recommend reviewing. Discuss them with
your team to decide which ones to follow, and write up your
own style guide for new members. If it’s in the team style
guide, it’s established, and development can continue. This
up-front work eliminates wasting time and effort debating
whether a rule from PSR-12 should be implemented. Admittedly, styling PSRs are not as impactful as other PSRs, but
they are significant in terms of collaboration and should be
considered just as important.

## Tech is Taking Sides

###### Beth Tucker Long

 Throughout history, industries have stayed relatively neutral during wartime. Global companies, especially, may offer marketing-focused messages of hope and concern but keep their heads down and their tones neutral when faced with actually taking a stand against one side of a conflict. Per usual, though, the tech industry is happy to disrupt the status quo—not just taking a clear stand but putting their money and their talent where their mouth is.


Global industries have long been accused of profiting off of
war by selling to all sides, especially those in manufacturing
and raw materials. Tech companies around the world, though,
are taking a defined stand and even putting aside opportunities to profit as they take sides in the current conflict between
Ukraine and Russia.
SpaceX has donated Starlink Internet communications
systems to keep people in Ukraine connected to the internet.
AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Vodafone have all waived
fees for services involving Ukraine—some waiving roaming
charges for customers in Ukraine, some waiving international
call fees for calls to and from Ukraine. Apple has halted all sales
through its Russian online store, shut down Apply Pay access
in Russia, and has disabled traffic and incident reports within
Ukraine in Apple Maps. Google, likewise, has disabled live
traffic reports for Ukraine in Google Maps, blocked Russian
state-sponsored media channels on YouTube, and paused ad
sales in Russia. Microsoft has stopped sales to Russia, and even
Netflix has gotten involved, suspending their services in Russia.
Even companies that are trying to just carry on with business-as-usual are having trouble staying uninvolved. Despite
not taking a public stand in the matter, Coinbase, Patreon, and
many other fundraising, financial, and social media platforms
have found themselves in the spotlight as their platforms are
being used heavily to support various organizations involved
in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It is no longer easy to keep your
head down and stay neutral.
Outside of work, the tech community is also getting involved.
Over 300,000 programmers have volunteered to become an “IT
Army” on behalf of Ukraine, taking down key Russian websites
and online services through coordinated DDoS attacks,
reporting disinformation on social media platforms, and
creating digital marketing campaigns to bring awareness to the
conflict. Anonymous has claimed credit for hacking Russia’s
television networks to broadcast footage from Ukraine and
for accessing the corporate systems of Rosatom, Russia’s state
corporation for nuclear energy, after they claimed ownership
of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant.
Regardless of the outcome of this conflict, it is no longer
isolated and localized. People around the world are getting


involved. Strangers are fighting together while sitting in their
living rooms halfway around the world from each other. One
thing is abundantly clear—tech has drastically changed the
landscape of war.
