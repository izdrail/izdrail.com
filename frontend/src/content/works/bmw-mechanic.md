## Motivation
This application was built at the request of a friend who is a BMW mechanic. 
He needed a way to diagnose the car remotely and to be able to see the car's status in real-time.
I've built this application to help improve my skills in **electrical engineering** and **hardware development**.
During my research I've managed to **reversed engineer** some of the INSPA system, which is the system that BMW mechanics use to diagnose cars.
Got to play with the CAN bus and the OBD2 protocol. (tba).


## Who is it for?
1. Bmw Mechanics
2. Car Owners


## What can it do?
1. Diagnose the car remotely using - SIM / IOT card
2. See the car's status in real-time - Using CAN bus
3. See the car's history
4. See the car's maintenance history and write a new maintenance log
