## Motivation
This application was built at the [Orange Hackathon](https://www.orange.com/) in 2024.
I've built this application to help people keep their social security safe and to fight cybercrime.
Talking with friends during my career as Software Engineer, I realized that many people don't know how to protect themselves from cybercrime, including my own family.


## Who Can Benefit from Sherlock?
Sherlock empowers individuals and organizations to leverage the power of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT).


1. Parents, teachers, students, and anyone else who wants to learn more about a person, organization, phone number, or email address.
2. Governments use these types of tools to gather information on potential threats and adversaries.
3. Law enforcement agencies can use it or implement to investigate crimes and identify suspects.
4. Cybersecurity professionals use OSINT to identify vulnerabilities and potential cyberattacks.
5. Businesses can use OSINT to gather information on competitors, customers, and market trends.
6. Journalists use OSINT to research and report on news stories.
7. Researchers use OSINT to gather information for their research projects.

## What can it do?
It is a mobile application that allows users to search for information about a phone number,email address, or domain name.
The application uses the available free SpiderFoot modules to perform the search.
The results are displayed in a user-friendly format, making it easy for users to understand and interpret the information.
