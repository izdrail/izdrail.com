In this post, we’ll explore the fascinating world of cryptography with one of the simplest and oldest encryption methods: the Atbash Cipher. We’ll take a closer look at how this cipher works, and we’ll also provide a PHP implementation for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## What Is the Atbash Cipher?
The Atbash Cipher is a substitution cipher, one of the earliest known, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with its reverse in the alphabet. Originally developed for the Hebrew alphabet, it is just as simple to implement for any alphabet, including English. Here’s how it works:

* Encryption: Each letter is replaced with its counterpart from the end of the alphabet. For example, 'A' becomes 'Z', 'B' becomes 'Y', 'C' becomes 'X', and so on.
* Decryption: This cipher is its own inverse, meaning that encrypting an encrypted message returns the original plaintext.

This makes the Atbash Cipher straightforward but effective for basic encryption needs.
