##### Introduction

306 billion.

[That’s the total number of business and consumer emails sent and](https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/)
received per day in 2020, on average.

What’s more, that number is forecasted to grow to over 376 billion
per day by the end of 2025.

As a marketer you’re probably thinking a few things at this point:

**1. How am I ever going to achieve inbox zero?**

**2. Forget my inbox, how am I going to make sure our business emails**
**stand a chance in our recipients’ inboxes with all that competition**
**taking up space?**

Well, let us start by offering you a bit of good news to take the edge off:
[73% of Millennials actually prefer business communication via email.](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats)

Phew. Okay. So despite all that clutter, you’ve still got a shot at earning
people’s attention -- but it’s not going to come easy. And perhaps more
than ever before, your subject line has got to shine.

To help you get a sense of exactly what that means in today’s modern
and messy inbox, we’ve pulled together 100 email subject lines that we
couldn’t help but click. We’ve organized these successful subject lines
into different categories within sales and marketing to help you

understand what to aim for in your word choice and positioning.

But first … a lesson in short copy.

##### A Short Lesson on  Writing Short Copy

You and your audience have something in common:
You want to write less, and they want to read less.

And email subject lines -- like blog post titles, tweet, and
meta descriptions -- don’t take up a whole lot of space.

For this reason, you’d think they must be easy to whip up.
Everyone is capable of stringing together a few words, right?

Wrong.

As it turns out, writing short copy takes more than just good
writing skills -- it requires a deep understanding of your target
customer and a knack for translating a larger message into a
few words designed to strike the right chord.

To help you train your brain to write more concisely,
we recommend pulling up a long-form piece of content
and running through the following steps:

Below, we’ll walk you through what it looks like to cut
a blog excerpt down into a tweet, a meta description,
and finally, a subject line.

The point of this exercise is to explore the ways in which
content can be reduced without losing its purpose.

##### 10 Types of Subject Lines Explained (+ 100 Examples)

###### MARKETING SUBJECT LINES


###### 1. Promotional Subject Lines

Subject lines for promotions or
limited-time offers are highly effective
at getting consumers to take action.

If you want to capture the attention
of your recipients, use your subject
line to highlight what they stand to
lose if they don’t open the email.

And remember: The more valuable
the offer is, the more nervous the
recipient will feel about giving it up.


###### Promotional Subject Lines Examples

1. The Honey Pot Co: “Get 15% off!”

2. Figgers Wireless: "    BIGGEST SALE OF THE YEAR! 50% OFF EVERYTHING!”

3. InstantBoss Club: “NEVER AGAIN SALE”

4. Sudara: “Last Day   All robes 20% off”

5. Thrive Market: “Limited time only: Extra 25% off + FREE gift”

6. Julep: “Last Day to Grab an Additional 50% OFF!”

7. Charles Tyrwhitt: “Shirts for $39 ENDS MIDNIGHT”

8. BaubleBar: “Up to 80% off for Labor Day Weekend!”

9. Boston Business Women: “FLASH SALE!    Join BBW for just $16 a month”

10. Figgers Wireless: “Reminder: Save 35% off the Figgers Smart TV today”

###### 2. Curious Subject Lines

In the world of email, action often
equates to better engagement rates.

A warm welcome is powerful. It
can get a reader to come back
again and again to your emails
until they’re ready to make their
first purchase or contact someone
from your team.

**“Curiosity keeps our mind engaged**
**to work out the implications,"**
[explains psychologist Gary Klein.](https://says.com/my/lifestyle/how-to-train-your-brain-to-see-what-others-dont)
And in order to work out the
implications, recipients need to click
through to gather more information
about what’s there.


###### Curious Subject Lines Examples

11. UX Collective: “Your fingerprints are all over the place”

12. Select All: “The Two Possible Futures of Virtual Reality”

13. Refinery29 Everywhere: “The $1,000 hair trend with a dirty little secret”

14. Tea Collection: “    Are You Ready To Spring It On?”

15. BaubleBar: “NEW (and you need it)”

16. Hiten from Product Habits: “2 hours before launch and we are still scrambling”

17. Instant Boss Club: “80 likes to 458 likes SAY WHAT?”

18. Brooklyn Boulders: “Are you taking advantage of this?”

19. Julep: “Sorry…”

20. Pocket: “How to Sleep. Sleep for Success. Why Eight Hours a Night Isn’t Enough”

21. Tory Burch: “This. Is. It.”

22. Apartment Therapy: “Why You Should Keep Your Clothes in the Freezer.”

###### 3. Funny Subject Lines

Your recipients’ email inboxes are inundated with ordinary subject lines all day, every day.

So how do you pique their interest in a sea of sameness?

Humor.

But remember: When using funny email subject lines, it’s important to know your audience.

While humor is a great way to appeal to your recipients’ emotions and engage
them in a memorable way, you want to ensure the joke resonates without offending
or alienating anyone.

###### Funny Subject Lines Examples

23. Funny or Die: “Revised policy regarding jean shorts at work”

24. Dollar Shave Club: “Open up and say wowie zowie!”

25. Rakuten: “    Peep Triple Cash Back deals before they’re gone!”

26. Brooks Brothers: “Up to 40% off trousers & sport coats. It’s a tailor-made sale.”

27. Dollar Shave Club: “What to Do When You’re the Sweaty, Smelly Guy at the Gym”

28. The Bouqs Company: “Pow-pop-boom-crackfsss” (Note: This was for a 4th of July sale.)

29. Groupon: “Hey… Were You Gonna Delete This?”

30. Rakuten: “    Will you accept this Double Cash Back?”


-----

###### 4. Pain Point Subject Lines

These days, businesses and individuals alike are constantly looking for ways to do more, see more, and earn more.
And as a marketer, it’s up to you to identify the obstacles that prevent them from doing so and use those insights to
position your product or service as part of the solution.

At the end of the day, people want to feel like their problems are recognized and being taken care of
-- and what better place to serve up that type of assurance than right in their inbox.

###### Pain Point Subject Lines Examples

31. J.Crew: “Your summer outfit dilemmas SOLVED”

32. Brooklyn Boulders: “Here's one way to meet your New Year's Resolution”

33. Terrain: “Your all-weather dining solution.”

34. Qapital: “Don’t think about saving. Save without thinking.”

35. ByRegina: “Struggling with a business decision? I made you a 1-page framework to help.”

36. Le Tote: “Monday-Friday Style Simplified”

37. Domino’s: “No address? No problem. Now Domino’s can deliver to over 150,000 Domino’s Hotspots.”

38. Matt and Kim: “Last minute gift idea from Matt but mainly Kim.”

39. Vidyard: “Engaging your prospects can be hard. Video makes it easy.”

40. Thrive Market: “Skip the store & shop healthy groceries from home”

###### 5. Reengagement Subject Lines

Subscriber inactivity happens to the best of us. Sometimes we see loyal subscribers gradually slip away as the
demands of their job increase or change. Other times we see people drop off because the content fails to meet their
needs. For that reason, reengagement emails are critical to list health and maintenance.

While there are a number of ways to reengage a contact -- from highlighting an improvement in your product to
promoting a discount to inviting them to revisit the items in their cart -- you have to get creative with your subject line
if you want to re-spark their interest.


###### Reengagement Subject

Lines Examples


41. Dollar Shave Club: “Hey, did you forget to open this?”

42. The Bouqs Company: “Can You Believe It’s Been a Month?”

43. Chubbies Shorts: “Lemme Teleport You Back to Your Cart. Free Of Charge.”

44. The Danger Booth: “     Something new (and virtual!) from The Danger Booth…”

45. ClassPass: “New things are happening!”

46. Julep: “A special gift to say we’re thankful for you.”

47. Rakuten: “Looks like you forgot something”

48. Marriott Rewards: “We’ve missed you, [Name]! Please come back!”

49. Dote Shopping: “Your shopping bag misses you.”

###### 6. Emoji Subject Lines

Emojis have quickly become powerful
communication tools, making it easier for
businesses to convey emotion in situations
where they are strapped for space.

Aside from the fact that emojis create
contrast in your recipients’ inbox, research
has found that emoji usage can actually
help make your message more memorable:

[According to Experian, 56% of brands](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/subject-line-stats-open-rates-slideshare)
[using emojis in subject lines had higher](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/subject-line-stats-open-rates-slideshare)
open rates.

When it comes to selecting the perfect
emoji for your subject line, it’s best to do
some testing of your own, though research
from HubSpot’s social team revealed the
following emojis lead to the most link clicks:


###### Emoji Subject Lines Examples

51. BaubleBar: “April showers bring     ”

52. Unsun Cosmetics: “Welcome to Unsun!     ”

53. Cat & Nat: “Whoa. We have a lot to share with you tonight   ”

60. Tea Drops: “A Little Welcome from Tea Drops Inside!   ”

###### 7. Social Proof Subject Lines

Social proof is the idea that people will adapt their behavior according to what other people are doing.

When we see a line of customers waiting to eat at a restaurant or a photo of a celebrity drinking a certain brand of
coffee, it lends an air of gravitas and quality to the product, doesn't it? But there's more to it than that.

[In fact, according to Buffer, there are actually six different types of social proof: Expert Social Proof, Celebrity Social Proof,](https://buffer.com/library/social-proof/)
User Social Proof, "Wisdom of the Crowds" Social Proof, "Wisdom of your Friends" Social Proof, and Certification Social Proof.
While the type of social proof you employ in your subject line will depend on the offer you’re promoting, the key is to focus
on removing doubt by highlighting evidence.


###### Social Proof Subject Lines Examples


61. Patagonia: “Top reviewed styles from customers like you”

62. HelloFresh: “Pssst… your friends are cooking up a storm!”

63. GolfNow: “You deserve some golf this week (top picks inside)”

64. Yummly: “Simple recipes from popular chefs”

###### 8. Personalized Subject Lines

platforms allow for smart personalization tokens where you can pull in the recipient’s name, company name, region,
and more, you have the power to get clever with subject lines, from local weather to product recommendations.

###### Personalized Subject Lines Examples

71. Verizon Wireless: “[Name], get our skincare faves FREE!”

72. Posh Candle Co: “Time to get lit [Name]”

73. NUDESTIX: “[NAME], have you tried our NEW Hydra-Peptide Lip Butter?

[engagement. Additionally, Vox found that their newsletter subscribers spend longer](https://uplandsoftware.com/postup/resources/blog/email-newsletter-statistics/)
on their website.

Offering an email subscription is a great way to get potential customers into your database
and interacting with your brand. To further engage your subscribers once they do hand
over their precious email address, create a compelling subject line to welcome them to
your communications.

###### SALES SUBJECT LINES

1. Problem-Based

In Sales, a major goal is to address a
problem your prospect is facing. Use
your prospect's most important goals

lines from various phases in the buyer’s
