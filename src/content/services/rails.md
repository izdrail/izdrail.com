# Ruby on Rails Development Company in London

Welcome to my [Ruby on Rails development company](https://izdrail.com) based in London, UK. I specialize in building custom, scalable, and maintainable Rails applications that power your business. Whether you’re starting from scratch or improving an existing project, I’m here to deliver high-performance solutions that meet your specific requirements.

## About Me

With over 10 years of hands-on experience in Rails, I’ve helped **companies** from startups to **enterprises** build robust applications that scale. My focus is on **writing clean**, efficient code while applying best practices that ensure performance, security, and maintainability.

I’m experienced with everything from rapid prototyping to building production-grade applications. If it’s Ruby on Rails, I’ve likely worked on it.

## Why Choose Me?

- **Deep Expertise**: Over a decade of Rails development, from small applications to large, complex systems. I’ve tackled everything from small e-commerce platforms to enterprise-grade solutions, ensuring every project is built with the best practices and scalability in mind.
- **Scalable Solutions**: I design systems that can grow with your business, ensuring your application performs well as traffic and data increase. Whether it’s through efficient database design, caching strategies, or background job processing, your app is built to scale without performance degradation.
- **Clean Code**: I follow best practices for maintainable, testable, and efficient code that’s easy to update. This includes writing modular, DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code, using proper naming conventions, and maintaining a well-documented codebase to ensure future developers can easily pick up where I leave off.
- **Performance-First**: I focus on optimizing performance and ensuring your application runs quickly and efficiently. Through careful database indexing, query optimization, caching, and load balancing, I ensure your app responds rapidly, even under heavy traffic.
- **Security**: I implement strong security measures to protect your app from common vulnerabilities and attacks. From using encryption for sensitive data to implementing secure authentication with tools like Devise, I ensure your app is robust and resistant to malicious attacks.
- **Collaborative Process**: I work closely with your team to ensure your vision is realized while providing technical advice to improve the final product. My approach is always to stay agile, adapt to feedback, and keep the lines of communication open throughout the development cycle.

## [My Services](/)

### Ruby on Rails Development

- **Custom Web Applications**: I build tailored Rails applications that meet your specific business needs. This includes designing intuitive user interfaces, building robust back-end logic, and ensuring the app is fast, reliable, and secure. Whether it’s an e-commerce platform, a content management system (CMS), or a marketplace, I’ve got you covered.
- **API Development**: I specialize in creating RESTful APIs that are efficient, secure, and well-documented. These APIs integrate seamlessly with external services and enable your applications to communicate with mobile apps, other platforms, or microservices.
- **Feature Development**: From implementing new features to refining existing ones, I deliver custom functionality designed to enhance user experience. Whether it’s integrating advanced search capabilities, building custom dashboards, or adding complex data processing workflows, I work on ensuring the feature matches the vision.
- **System Integrations**: I integrate Rails applications with third-party services such as payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), email services (SendGrid, Mailchimp), CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), and other APIs. I ensure that the integration is seamless, secure, and error-free, making your app more versatile and feature-rich.
- **Migration Services**: If you're migrating from another platform to Rails, or upgrading your existing Rails project to a newer version, I ensure the process is smooth and hassle-free. I handle data migrations, system configuration updates, and any necessary changes to ensure the app runs perfectly on the new platform.

### Frontend Development

- **Responsive Design**: I build mobile-friendly, responsive web interfaces that work across all devices, ensuring users get the best experience, regardless of screen size. I use techniques like media queries, flexbox, and grid systems to ensure your app is optimized for smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
- **UI Development**: I develop interactive and engaging user interfaces using the latest frontend technologies. This could involve implementing dynamic features like infinite scrolling, drag-and-drop elements, or advanced forms with validation, all crafted to increase user satisfaction and conversion rates.
- **Frontend Frameworks**: I incorporate modern frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js to create a more dynamic and responsive user interface. This allows for real-time data updates, enhanced user interactions, and improved performance by loading only the necessary data when needed.

### Backend Development

- **Database Design & Optimization**: I design relational databases that are optimized for performance and scalability. By carefully indexing tables, using normalized schemas, and optimizing queries, I ensure that the database performs well, even as your data grows.
- **Server-Side Logic**: I develop and maintain the server-side logic that powers your application. This includes building RESTful APIs, handling business rules, and integrating external services. I also ensure background jobs (using tools like Sidekiq) are efficiently managed to process tasks asynchronously, improving user experience.
- **Performance Tuning**: I conduct thorough performance analysis using tools like New Relic or Skylight to pinpoint bottlenecks. From query optimization to efficient caching strategies (Redis, Memcached), I make sure your application is fast and responsive at all times.
- **Security Implementation**: I implement modern security protocols such as SSL/TLS encryption, CSRF protection, and input validation to safeguard your application from common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS). I also manage secure authentication systems (Devise, OAuth) to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.
- **Code Refactoring**: I regularly refactor code to improve readability, efficiency, and maintainability. This includes breaking up large classes into smaller, more manageable ones, removing duplicated code, and ensuring the app is in a good state for future development.

### Support & Maintenance

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monthly maintenance packages ensure your Rails application continues to perform well. This includes regular code reviews, updating dependencies, and addressing minor issues before they become critical problems.
- **Retainer Support**: Flexible, retainer-based support allows you to get timely assistance whenever needed. Whether it’s bug fixes, performance enhancements, or new feature requests, I offer a support model that works for your team.
- **Security Patches**: I stay on top of the latest security updates and apply necessary patches quickly. By monitoring CVEs and ensuring timely updates to dependencies, I protect your application from potential security threats.
- **Performance Monitoring & Improvements**: I set up automated monitoring tools (such as Datadog, Prometheus) to track application performance in real-time. I proactively optimize slow queries, reduce load times, and implement caching strategies to maintain performance.
- **Bug Fixing**: I promptly address any bugs or issues that arise, ensuring that your app stays stable. From debugging complex issues to conducting in-depth code audits, I ensure your application is fully functional.
