## Laravel Mail
Community inspired mail platform for your laravel application.
Reduce your mail costs and focus on your business. Use Workflows to drive your business revenue.


## Features

### GrapesJS Editor.
With the help of GrapesJS you will be able to create your own templates for your mail campaigns.

### Advanced Workflows
I've inspired from the42coders/workflows for this platform
so that you will be able to use drag and drop to build workflows for your mail campaigns.


### Advanced Imports.
With a very powerful csv importer you will be able to import any contacts to your platform.

### Multiple workspaces
Handle multiple workspaces or teams through a single interface.

### Email Intelligence
Using the power of docker, you will be able to run risk assessments and check for your users' email addresses.
