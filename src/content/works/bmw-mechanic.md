## Motivation
This application was built at the request of a friend who is a BMW mechanic. He needed a way to diagnose the car remotely and to be able to see the car's status in real-time.
I've built this application to help improve my skills in **electrical engineering** and **hardware development**.
During the development I've **reversed engineer** the INSPA system, which is the system that BMW mechanics use to diagnose cars.
Got to play with the CAN bus and the OBD2 protocol. (tba).
