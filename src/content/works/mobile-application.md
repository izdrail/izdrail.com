## Motivation

The creation of this application was driven by the demand for a mobile-friendly solution to perform intelligence tasks efficiently and reducing fraudulent activities.
By building upon the capabilities of the well-known O.S.I.N.T tool, **SpiderFoot**, 
I have crafted a versatile and user-friendly application that addresses the growing needs of cybersecurity professionals.

OSINT is a term that refers to the collection of information about a person, organization, phone number, or email address.

## Who is it for?
Parents, teachers, students, and anyone else who wants to learn more about a person, organization, phone number, or email address.
Governments use OSINT to gather information on potential threats and adversaries.
Law enforcement agencies use OSINT to investigate crimes and identify suspects.
Cybersecurity professionals use OSINT to identify vulnerabilities and potential cyberattacks.
Businesses use OSINT to gather information on competitors, customers, and market trends.
Journalists use OSINT to research and report on news stories.
Researchers use OSINT to gather information for their research projects.


## What can it do?

It is a mobile application that allows users to search for information about a phone number,email address, or domain name.
The application uses the available free SpiderFoot modules to perform the search.
The results are displayed in a user-friendly format, making it easy for users to understand and interpret the information.


## Python Spider Foot Module
The application also includes a Python module developed for querying orange hub.


## Source code
The source code for the application is available on GitHub at:
